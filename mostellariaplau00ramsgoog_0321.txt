perhaps we ought in all such cases to resolve etihm into its component
parts and write them separately‚ as et iam It must be borne in mind

time previously. So, when we say ‘he is even now beating his
slave‚’ or ‘he is even now mocking me,' these words may iudicate
that the person spoken ol is continuing an action previously corn·
