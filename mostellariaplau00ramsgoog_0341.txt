208 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Qmillute lecum ‘what's that you're muttering to yourselfl' Tranio
starts and replies in confusion, ll'iln‘l, ⁴0 nothing, I was speaking
for. . .' and then breaks off abruptly in order, before committin'g
himself, to ascertain exactly what Theuropides had heard from the
seller. The broken sentences are a mark of confusion and em·
barrassment. '

On the same principle we explain Cas. 11. vi. rr. 'ibe sorhb'o
which is to decide the fate of Casina is about to take place in the
presence ol Stalino and his wife Cleostrata Stalino who, for his own
ends, is eager on behalf of Olympio, says, S. Adpone lic sitellam,
sortes cedo mihi: anthuni advorh'le Atque ego cernui aps le posse hoc nte
narrare, uxor mea, Cosaba ul uxor madidaretur, el nunc etiam censeo.
C. Tibi daretur illa! S. Mihi maht-alt! id non volui dt'cm, Dum
miti volui ltue'c disi: alque adeo dum malti cupii> perperam Iamdudum
hercle fabulor. C. Pollu quidem: alque elram saa’s. Stslino is so
eager and agitated that he becomes thoroughly confused, and un·
avares discloses the real state of his feelings. He begins by saying,
‘I thought, my dear wife, that 1 might have obtained from you this
favour, that Casina should be made over as awife to-,' and then
malti slips out instead of Olyvmpthm'. On this Cleostrata very naturally
exclaims in wonder, ‘She given to youl’ Stalino‚ carried away by
his excitement, does not at first perceive his blunder, and continues,
‘yes, to me, for-,' and then, becoming aware of what he bad said,
interrupts himself, ‘no, no, I did not mean to say that‚’ and then, in
his terror, he gets hopelessly involved, and plunges deeper and deeper
at every step. We ought therefore to punctuate, C. Tibi daretur
illa! S. lllt'ltt', carin—ahl ld non volui dehere, Dum mr'lti volui hut
dtist', alque adeo dunt mt'lvi cupio-perperam Iamdudum, hercle, fabulor,
&c.‚ making another abrupt stop after captiv, where Stalino becomes
sensible that he is still floundering, and endeavours to get out by
adding, ‘by Hercules, I have been talking nonsense for some time!
To this Cleostrata dryly assents, ‘yes, you have been and you are
still talking nonsense!
