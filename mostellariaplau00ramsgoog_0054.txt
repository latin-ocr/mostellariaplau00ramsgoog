Α ORTHOGRAPHY. xxxvii

worthless, because the writers would in most cases represent the
orthography prevalent in their own day.

Where the question arises asto the insertion or omission of an
aspirate at the beginning of a word, or between two vowels, we have
absolutely nothing to guide us; but in so far as Plautus is con-
cerned, we might be saie in omitting it after a mute, and inwriting
Cort'ntuc, Corrago, Antr'ocus, Agutocles, BACANAE [10 quaterJ, Pulcer,
BRACIVM [12], Arcr'tectus, sepulcrum, teatrum, tnicmpun although
we could scarcely bring ourselves to adopt the form Pr'lipus, which
is found on a coin, especially as Phr‘lr'ppus appears on other pieces
belonging apparently to the same epoch; and, generally speaking, in
proper names, and especially those of foreign origin and rare occur·
rence, we cannot look for accuracy, or adhere to Latin rules; and
hence we may retain the Greek spelling, and adopt Philolaches, Phile-
matr'um, and Τ heuropt'drs‚ instead of Pilolcces‚ Pr'lcmalritm, T europriles.

In so far as the rule of Quintilian is concemed‚ it is closely '
observed in inscriptions. We have indeed an aspirato before a
vowel at the commencement of a few words which disearded the
aspirate at a later period, such as HARENATO, n. 557, HOLI·
TOR, n. 1057, HERVCINA, n. 14953 on the other hand, it does
not appear in EREDES,n. 1034, OSTlh, n. 819, ARRESPEX,
n. 1348, ERCEISCVNDA [19 br’s]. The only violation of the'
precept which forbids the use of the aspirato after a consonant, in
a word not a proper name, is SEPVLCHR(um) in n. 1107(but
there is nothing to lix the date of this inscription with certainty), and
the proper name, PHISIDAE, which occurs in 18, B.C. 71, but
which is evidently a mere blunder, since the word (PlSlDAE)
appears in its correct form repeatedly in the same inscription.
PVLCHER‚ as a proper name, appears on a Denarius minted in
all probability towards the close of the Republic, on some coins
struck in Asia, and on a fragment of sculpture found at Eleusis.

Q.

Although q was never extensively employed by the Romans, it
certainly was employed commonly, at an early period, in certain
words in which it was afterwards supplanted by c. Foremost among
these is PEQVNIA, which is written with a q in the great majority
of cases in the oldest inscriptions, although, curiously enough, the
first example of the word is in 10, where it appears as PECVNIAM.
Thus PECVNIA and its cases taire aQ about twenty-six times iu 11,
