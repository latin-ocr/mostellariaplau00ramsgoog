a later hand To the same class belong erasures made we cannot

. tell by whom, as in 1. i. 42,

Non omnes possunt olere unguenta exota'ca,
which was originally written in B,

Non omnes possunt tolera unguenta monia,
but the t has been erased, leaving only a faint trace, and this erasure
may or may not have been the work oi the first hand Ritschl
therefore is hardly justified in giving tolere as the reading ol Ba
without remark*

3. Corrections in inlr which is periectly black, and which must
proceed from a late hand Most ol the stops and marks oi interro·
gation have been added by this hand These corrections in blaclr
inl< are made in two ways, either in the word, or over the word
Thus in 1. i. 15 the writing in the original brown inlr has

Rus nu'hi tu obz'ecta sanchcredo tramit,
but an s is added in blaclr ink at the end of obiecta· oc has been
added to the lr in inlr darker than the original,† but this may arise
from an erasure made between sane and credo, some wrong word

having stood there. A point has been added in red inlr after abactas,

so that the whole now stands,

Rus malai tu obr'eclas. saffiram lram'o.

Again, 1. i. 3¹ was written originally in B,
Ante hoc est baltius pocus nec magas conuiuas,
but an r has been inserted in blaclr inlr aiter a in pocta, and an
n also in black written over the a in cananeas, so that the line
now appears in the MS.
Antehac est hebrius phata nec magt's contritehs.
This hand is called Bb by Ritschl.

4. Corrections on the margin, written in a particularly neat, small
hand with a line-pointed pen, and preceded by a t. The inlr oi
this hand is intermediate in colour between the brown os the original
MS. and the jet·black os the last corrector. This hand is called
Bc by Ritschl. We have a good example ol the correction of this
hand in Ι. i. 5,

, ‚ ‚ ‚ , recline.
Exi mquam . mdore copinam quad iales* ‘

“[My oXinion ls that thetis by the first hand. The inlisof the same
colonr, an the correction appears to have been made at once-En]

†[l cannot agree with the author in thinking the inh oi this cor-
rection darier than that oi the original writing. lt appears to me to be,
it anything, somewhat iaintcr than the average-En]
