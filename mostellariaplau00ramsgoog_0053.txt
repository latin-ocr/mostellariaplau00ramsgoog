The ancient Romans employed the aspirate more sparingly than
their descendants. They did not employ it before a vowel at the
beginning of many words in which it was afterwards generally
adopted, and they excluded it altogether from those syllables in
which it was afterwards placed after a consonant. Thus Quintil. 1. Ο.
1. v. 7, “Parcissime ea veteres usi sunt etiam in vocalibus, quum
aedos, ircosque dicebant. Diu deinde ,servatum ne consonantibus
aspiraretur, ut iu Graccis et menapis. Erupit brevi tempore nimius
usus, ut choronae, chenturrbnes, praechones, adhuc quibusdam inscrip-
tionibus maneant: qua de re Catulli nobile epigramma est.'’ And
Cicero, Orat. XLVIII. §160‚ confirms the statement of Quintilian,
“QuIn ego lpse, quum scirem ita maiores locutos esse ut nusquam
nisi iu vocali aspiratione uterentur, loquebar sic ut polenos, Cetegas,
trr'urnpos, Kartaginem, dIcerem,” &c

Although the use of the aspirate became more common in the age
of Cicero and of Augustus, it was again dropped to a considerable
extent in the decline of the language: thus Marius Victorinus (fourth
or fifth century), p. 2466, when speaking of the use of lt in certain
words, “Sed credo vos antIquitatem sequi, sed quum asperitas vetus
illa paulatim ad elegantioris vitae sermonisque est limam perpolita,
sic vos quoque has voces siue H secundum consuetudinem nostri
seculi scribite;” where, when speaking of antiquitas and vetus illa
asperitas, he must be understood to referto the Augustan age.
Hence, in a matter of this sort, the testimony of MSS. is absolutely
