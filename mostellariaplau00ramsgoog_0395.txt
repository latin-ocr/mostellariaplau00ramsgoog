in a speech ol the elder Cato, quoted also by nul Geu.xl.1s,
Fures priuatorum furtorum e'n nervo atque r'n compedibus aetatem agrum .·
fures publici r'n auro atque e'n purpura. ln one passage ol Plautus
it may signily ‘a strap’ or ‘cord ι’ Cure. V. iii. ιι, Atque r'ta te neruo
torquebo elidem utr' catapultae solent,· and here there is probably a pun.
Freund is certainly mistalren when he quotes, as an example ol
nervus in the sense os a ‘sinew' or ‘muscle,' the line from the
Poenulus V. iv. 99, where Hanno says to his newly-disoowered
daughter, Condamus alter alterum ergo in nervom brachialem: he mearrs,
‘let us shut up each other in the prison ol our arms,' οι, it we choose
to take necarer to mean ‘a collar,' it will be, ‘let us encircle each
others necks in the collar ol our arms! We find it iu the metapho-
rical sense os ‘mental strength,’ ‘power,' ‘energy,' lor the first time
in Eun. II. iii. 21, Sr'oe odeo digna res cst ubi tu neruos intendas tuos,·
but it may be fairly doubted whether there is here any figurative
allusion to an anatomical term.

When a slave had been detected in any serious offense, he was
usually seized upon the spot, and bound hand and loot to prevent
him lrom running oli* or lrorn taking reluge in some sanctuary,†
and was frequently kept in prison until his sate was deeided Hand·
culis were called ncanccoc or copulae: thus lllost. V. i. ιγ (ii. a),
Continuo exsultatis: monacos celeriter conectr'tc; Capt. 111. v. ι, Incct’te
huic mantem montegeleni Epid. V. l. ιι, Quacrr'lont nte, c'n mam'bus
gestant copulas sesuncras. Fetters lor the leet were compedes or maiae,
and were riveted on: nul. IV, i. 15, Qui eo aerabc't apstinebit censione
bubula, Nec sua opero rediget umquam c'n splendorem compedes,· Capt.
IlI.iv.118, H. Verbo mihi data csse ordeo Τ. Quid cessator, com·
pedes, Currere ad nce, nuaque amplecti crura, ut uos mstoaame Pers.
IV. iv. 24, Ferrcas tute tr‘dc' r‘npe‘ngc'§ cubem crassas compeder,· Poen.
ΙΙΙ. i. 10, Nam iste quidem gradus suberetus est cribro pollc'nareh, Nc'sr'

* Sceledrus in Mil. ll. vi. 99, Nam iam aliquo arejicgiam, et me occultabo
aliquot dies, Dum hae consilescunt turbae atque r'rae lenim.

† So Tranio, Most. V. i. 45 (li. 30), seats himself u n an altar.

Ι We have manicae again in As. ll. ii. 38. Mania in Plautus signihes
‘a little hand:’ Rud. 1V.iv. 125, Pseud. V. i. ιο. By Varro L. L. V. 31,

ᾧ ι 35, it is explained to mean the cross-har passing through theatina of a ’

plough, which was grasped hy the ploughman, ‘the handle of the plough?

h Cf. Men. l. i. 9, ‘lum compediti anum lima perterunt, Aut lapide excutiunt
clavom, where anum, is this reading is correct, must be equivalent to
anulum, and clavom must he the rivetingholt.
