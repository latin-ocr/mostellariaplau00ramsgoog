both avowel and also a consonant, which, itis probable, had the
sound of an English y, the Augustan poets permitted themselves
occasionally to give it the force of aconsonant in certain words in
which it properly represented avowel. Thus the words, abutatur,

be inadmissible in Dactylic verse, were pronounced and scanned

as quadrisyllables, abyetibus, paryctibus, the first syllable being now
made long by position. So also, without the plea of absolute
