noras

1. i. 1. Exi. . joran] Ol the two forms os the word signilying a
door, fora ol the first declension‚ andfore's ol the third, the former
is found only in the accusative plural soros, and trie ablative plural
suis, and these are by some grammarians designated as adverbs.
We may say a lew words upon each.

Fossa—let. In the great majority ol cases in which foras is
employed it is combined with averb which implies the movement oi
the person or thing addressed or spoken of from the interior of a
house to the door. The verbs generally used are, soros ire, abire,
exire, exsurgere, effugere, efferre, educere, seducere, deferre, excludere,
extrudere, excire, excr'tore, eriere, uocare, conare, egredi, progredi,
pellere, edere se, proruere se*, prosequi, and the like. Less common
but still conveying the same idea, Trin. ΙΙ. ii. r, Quo illic horso
[oras se penetravi! ex aedelur? Eun. 11. iii. 66, Homo quatr'elur certe
cum dono foras, ‘hurled, kicked out! Sometimes the expression is
figurative without reference to a door, as in Rud. 1. ii. 82, sturlus ee‘ecit
soros, ‘the wave has cast her lorth ;’ and Truc. 1. i. 18, paces. . eduxi!
serras, os drawing fish out olapond in anet; and in Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 68
(64), abire foras is ‘to go to aloreign land ς’ and still stranger, Phor. V.
vii 65, Vides peccalum tuum erse delatumsoros‚ ‘carried out,' i.e. ‘has
been hinted abroad‚ has been disclosed.' 2nd. The idea of motion
outwards, although always implied, is in one or two phrases much less
direct Thus since vocari ad cenamsoras means ‘to be invited out to
dinner‚’ so promrltereforas od cenom means ‘to accept such an invita·
tion,' ⁴ to promise to go out to dinner! Thus Rud. V. iii. 64, Neue adeo
uocaus credam uos esse ad cenom foras,· and Most· 1V. iii. 12 (iv. ια),
Promr'se'foras Ad cenam, ne me te vocare censeas ,· and Stich. IV. ii. 16,

* ln Eun. 111. v. 31, Foras simul omnes promerent se is used with reference
to persons hurrying out of a soom in the interior oia house in order to
proceed into another apartment. ’
