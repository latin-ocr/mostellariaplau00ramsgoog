142 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

page will supply examples. The only passage in any classical writer
in which tarro does not imply motion is in Cato R. R. 57 ᾗ 7, who,
when descanting on the virtues ol pickled cabbage, declares, Et ri
bt'lrir alra est, et εἰ Ir'eeres turgent, et si cor dolet, et si iecur, culpatorum,
aut praecordia, uno verbo omnia sano Jizcr'et r'ntro quae deluebant,
although he had said in the previous sentence, Si quid anteo moli
inlus erit. Forcellini quotes a passage from Palladius 1. 40, ut si
pr'lom'mrireris, r'ntro stare non posst'l, where, however, the difficulty is
removed hy a slight change in the punctuation, which ought to be,
si priam miseris thiro, stare non possit.

48. eveniunt] So the MSS. Nonius (p. 509) quotes a line from
the Hecuba ol Ennius in which he employs evenat lor eveniet, and
hence Both. and R would here read evenant, but the introduction
ol this iorrn here is altogether uncalled sor. cf. Cure. 1. i. 39;
Epid. II. ii. 105, III. i. ²3 Trin. 1. ii. 3; in some ol which the change
may be made with propriety. See also pervertant, Rud. 111. ii. 1²3
Trin. 1. ii. 56.

54. mutire] ‘to spealr even in a whisper.' Muto or nmero signifies
properly ‘to speak through compressed lips,’ and hence ‘to spealr
in a whisper,' and sometimes ‘to mutter' or ‘ grumble,’ as in Ariph.
Ι. i. 225, M. Etiam mutae S. Iam tacebo. Occasionally it is used
humourously with regard to inanimate objects, as in Curc.I. iao,
ol a door (ostrum), Bellissumum hercle nr'di et lacrlurm'ssumum, Num·
quom ullum verbum mutel: quom operetur, taccu and again, u. 93, Vtile!
ut operiantur aedessestr'vrisumae! Non muti! cardo .· so also neu ue'rgae
mutilent, Poen. Prol. 18. Other examples ol mutere will be lound in
Amph. l. iii. ης Bac. IV. vii. a; Men. V. i. 113 Mil. 11. vi. 83;
Pers. V. ii. 4⁶ ; Andr. 111. ii. 25. In one passage in Terence, Hec.
V. iv. 26, mulz're must signify ‘to be silent :' P. Dic mehr, harum rerum
num quid aaa· compatri? B. ll'r'lu‘l. P. Neque opus est: Adeo mureto.-
place! non fieri hoc ririiem, ut in coneoedrii Omm'a omnes ubi resciscunt:
&c., where adeo mutr'to must mean ‘be silent then' or ‘remain silent’*
We have also a substantive mutuo in Amph. I. iii. 21, a line which
we have quoted above in the note on 1. i. 33. The frequentative
lorm musso is found in Aul. 11. i. 12, Neque occultum r‘d haberi neque

*Freund takes this quite differently3 he seems to suppose that metito· ·
is the ablative of the participle, and would construe neque opus est adeo
mutire, ‘there is no need of whispering it about ;' but is that were the
construction it would rather mean, ‘there is no need of speaking about it
in a whisper.’ i.e. ‘ you may spealr openly if you please,' which is directly
the reverse of the obvious sense of the passage.
