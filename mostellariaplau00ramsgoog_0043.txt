PROLEGOMENA.

orthography os long Vowels.

Quintilian and sorne of the later grammarians explicitly state that
in the earliest times long syllables were distinguished in writing by
doubling the vowel. Thus 1. Ο. lssvii. 14:

“ semivocales non geminare diu fuit usitatissimi moris: atque e
contrario usque ad Accium et ultra, porrectas syllabas geminis, ut
dixi, vocalibus scripserrmt. Diutius duravit, ut e, i, iungendis, eadem
ratione qua Graeci ει, uterentur. Ea casibus numerisque discreta
est, ut Lucilius praecipit '' &c

And Mar. Victor. p. 2456, “Naevius et Livius, cum longa syllaba
scribenda esset, duas vocales ponebant, praeterquam quaein 1 literam
inciderant, hanc enim per E et Ῑ scribebant.''

Acting upon this principle, Dtintyer, who published an edition of
the fragments os Livius Andronicus (Berol. 1835), represents them
in the following fashion:

“ In seedeis collocat see reegiaas
Clutaimneestra iuxtim, tertiaas naatai occupant
* * * *
Quin, quod paareere voos maaiestaas mea
Procat‚ tolerantis, templooque hanc deeduucitis.''

But in so sar as the doubling oi vowels is concemed, it seems
certain that no such system prevailed generally at the period when
our oldest inscriptions were engraved, and these belong to an epoch
as remote as Livius, and much more remote than Pacuvius, Accius,
and Ennius. Thus on the tombs oi Scipio Barbatus and his son
we have CORNELIVS, BARBhTVS, PROGNths DVO-
NORVM, vrrrrt'rrm, vos ossmts

The practice was not altogether unknown, ior we find a few
examples here and there, but these are so rare that we might almost
ascribe them to ignorance or accident. In the whole oi the twenty
inscriptions we have enumerated above there are only seven in-
stances, and the whole of these are found in 16 (No. aon Momm),
which is as late as B.C. 81, viz. HAACE LEGE, HOiCE
LEEGEI, SEESE twice, LVVCI (from LVX), and PEGVLATVV*
twice, while in the same inscription LEGE or LEGEM occur three
times, and LVCl twice.

d* Observe that both luuci and pegalatuu are anomalous on other con-
ει erattons.
