lxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Either ol the long syllables os the Cretic may be resolved, and in
this way the fourth Paeon (o υ υ -) and the first Paeon (- υ υ υ)
become admissible, thus-

Fourth Paeon in sud,

Murice hercle eigilis aetatem ita set vos decet.

Fourth Paeon in 3rd,

Nos perficio probe ul holstiensis vestietur.

Fourth Paeon in rst and first Paeon iu 3rd,

Dominus indiligens reddire suas nevolt.

But, in addition to these leet, the Romans (not the Greeks) admit
the Molossus. This doctrine was first distinctly laid down by Bentley,
in his notes on Cic. Tusc. 111. 19, and Terent. Adel. IV. iv. a*

Examples are common- ⁴

In rst and and,

Vino i! vieti piseeitu probo electili.
In rst and 3rd,
processerunt elo ul duis [dela haud nego.

In rst, and, and 3rd,

Venit naues nistrde ndoi queie srdngal ratem,
where naus's is to be pronounced as a monosyllable.

Generally speaking, the Cretic vindicatos to itsels the 4th place,
but even into this the Molossus and the fourth Paeon occasionally
intrude, but not the first Paeon.

According to what has been said the scheme ol the Cretic
Tetrameter Acat. will be·-

There is another point connected with the scansion ol Cretic
‘l’etrameters which deserves special attention, via, that the two halves
are Asynartete‚ and thus the last syllable os the second foot may

not very precise nor easily applied—‘⁴ qui pes tamen ita temperari solet, ut
aut propter ambiguitatem mensurae non sit molossus, ut in lauti Captivis
ll. i. 113 aut solutos sinat, quos argento emerit, vel ubi concede bue, secede
huc, et similia retracto in primam syllabam accentu dicuntur3 aut a pro·
nuntiatione accentum solum sequente obscuretur, ut in Rudente 1. v. 15,19,

Quaene eiectas e mari ambae suentes, te opsecro
Vt tuo recipias tecto, servesque nos.”
