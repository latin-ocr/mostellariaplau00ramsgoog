tlrat inconciliare denoted ‘to separate,' ‘to set at variance,' ‘to disturb,'
ameaning which would suit the passage before us. But it has been
objected that this interpretation is contrary to analogy‚-that although
in has frequently a negative force when compounded with adjectives
or participles, it never has this force when compounded with verbs.
The old grammarians seem to have been in doubt as to the meaning
of thromiiibm tlrus Festus, or rather Paulus Diaconus, p. 107, ed.
Mtlll.‚“Inconcilrbsti, comparasti, commendasti, vel, ut antiqui‚perdolum
decipere,'' where it is supposed that onnyui is intended to indicate
Plautus. The passages in which the word occurs are the following:
r. Bac. 111. vi. ar, Ille, quod in se suit, adcuratote habui quod posset
mali Facere eiiii me incomitiare copies omnes nuos. This is the reading
of the MSS. Camer. proposes socero et, while R retains socero! and
reads humiliorem the former connects in me with rirconcilrbre, the
latter with faceret. It must be observed that the change proposed
hy R is more violent than that introduced by Camer., indeed the
substitution olfacere et forsoceret cannot be regarded as a change
at all—according to either reading, ‘to set at variance with me,' ‘to
disturb or throw into confusion,’ ‘to stir up against me,’ would be
a satisfactory meaning. a. The line in the Mostellaria, now before

printed editions, but the MSS. here are so corrupt that it is hard to
say whether the word reconciliauit is indicated at all, and therefore
we can found nothing upon this passage* On the whole, if we
admit that reconciliare cannot signify to ‘disunite,’ there is no reason
why it should not mean ‘to unite against,' ‘to stir up opposition,’
and so ‘to bring trouble upon any one,' which will suit the passage
from the Mostellaria, and hence, ultimately, ‘to injure' or ‘deceive'
