antecedent to qui is cistellam cum crepundiis (a. 43), or simply cistellam
(a. 46). lf we read with all the best MSS· in As. ΙΙ. ἰίἱ. 135, ligurii

was here equivalent to quas, but in this, and perhaps in some of the

Quin occurs perpetually in the dramatic writers, and modilies the
clauses with which it is combined in so many different ways that it
demands close attention. We may perhaps class the different mean-
ings under three heads. Of these, two are simple and distinct, but
the third is somewhat complicated.

1. Quin is employed in direct interrogations, in which case it is
followed by the indicative, and is equivalent to cur nan. We may
fairly regard quin here as representing qui non or qul ne. (On qut
see preceding Excursus.) Quin is not unfrequently followedby the

the iorce of a direct interrogation, as we shall point out below.

2. Quin is employed in negative propositione, or in propositione
in which a negation is implied, as equivalent to ut non, and is followed
by the subJunctive. Here qum, in most cases, represents qui narr,-
i.e. ul is nort.

3. Qm'n is employed very frequently in dialogue to introduce an
explanation of some statement or remark made previously, either by
the speaker himself or by the person with whom he is conversing.
It must be borne in mind that a speaker may repeat the remark of
another in different words, for the purpose of ascertaining that he
has correctly understood the remark in question, secking an ex·
planation, as it were; or he may repeat a remark previously made ,
by himself, for the purpose of making his meaning more clear, thus
giving an explanation, and all this may be done without emotion,
or with an expression of anger or of impatience, and the emotion may
in many cases bc indicated by the tone ol the speaker, and hence not
