emere. Lucilius lib. XXVII: socr'o, ad unonem veneo, tribus in
libertatem molr'bur Destinerssf Cic. Epp. Fam. VII. xxiii. 6 3, when
speaking 01 2122 purchase 01 several works 01 art, Quod tibi destinaras
τραπεζοφόρον, site delectat, habebr's·; sin autem sententiam mutasti, ego
habebo ser'lr‘eet. Plautus uses also the verb Praestono, manifestly con·
nected with the same root as Destino, in the sense 01 ‘to purchase'
Thus Paul. Diae. p. 233, ed. Muli, “Praestrnare apud Plautum prae-
emere est, idest emendo tenere ;” thus Capt. IV, ii. 66, Iuben an non
tubes astituiaulasi patinas elui? Laeuium atque epulassoroere'socule‘sser·
ventibus? Alium pisces praestinatum abire? Epid.11.ii. 90, E. Quasi

argento, priusquam ueneat filiios,· Pseud. I. ii. 36, Ego eo in macellum
ut piscium quidquid est pretio praesumem. The word seems to occur
in no other author until it was revived by Apuleius, who employs
it repeatedly: Met. 1. 5, 24, IV. 15, VII. 9, VIII. 23, 24, ΙΧ. 6, 20;
Apol. 101. See note 01 Hildebrand on VII. 9.

111. arraboni] See also III. iii. 15 (IV. ii. 15), IV. iii. 21 (iv. 22).
The word arrabo, which appears also under the shape 01 arra, is taken
directly 120222 2122 Greek ᾰῤῥαβὼν, which again is taken 120222 2 Hebrew
verb sIgnilying ‘to promise‚’ ‘to become security! Both words are
frequently found written with an aspirate arrha and arrhabo, but
these forms probably belong 20 a period 01 2122 language subsequent
to the ageos Plautus. Technically an arrabo was a partlal payment
made by 2 purchases when he concludcd abargain, in security that he
would not repudiate his engagement. The French word les arrhes is
identical in meaning, and in Scotland the comest-penny given to a
servant when hired is called the artes. Thus Rud. Prol. 45, otoni tri·
ginta sibo' puellam destinat Datque arrabonem et iureiurando adlegats and
so again, in reference to the same transaction 11. vi. 71, III. vi. 23,
120222 which it is evident that when a seller received an arrabo he was
bound to abide by his bargain. In Poen. V. vi. 22 12 is used more
loosely 20 denote an object seiaed as security or compensation for
a dcbt, leno arrabonem hoc pro mena meeumsero; and in Heaut. III.
iii. 42 an object (a girl) left as security for money borrowed‚ Ea
(sc. filia adulescentula) relicta huoi arraboni est pro illo argento. In

Mil. IV. i. 11 it is used figuratively: Palaestrio, presenting a ring to ᾗ

the soldier, says, Hunc arrabonem amoris primm a me occrpe; and in
Truc. III. ii. 22 there is an elaborate joke in consequence 01 aslave
havIng by design or accident said rabonem instead 01 arrabonem:
A. Perti! Robonem, quom esse dicam hone ultrane Quin tu arrabonem
