reformo, proposed ω introduce a new char-aeter into the Latin
alphnbet, the Antisigmn )(, which might serve as the represenutive
os ψ. See especially Priscian. pp. 5⁵⁷. 5⁶⁶; Vel. Long. pp. ²²²⁴-

Before quitting this subject, we may notice that the preposition ab,
oecaionauy, admugi- rarely, appears under the form os ψ thus in

nme, AB REG10; ιι. 1143, AF MVRO; n⁴ 1161, AF SOI-05

Ten Lntin words end with the letter d—Ad, AM Apud, Haud,
Id, lund, lim, Quid, Quo-1, Sed. ιι seems certain that. in ιιιει
times ιι least, the sound os d in these words oould not be distin-
guishm from that os t. and that, in writing them, 1 ven frequently
substituted sor d. Thus Quintil. 1.0. Ι4 vii. 5, “ 1112 quoque servm
eet a multis differentia, in ad. quum esset praepositio, D liv-emm,
quum nutem ooniunctio, T accipere& These words clearly indicate
that, whichever letter wu employed, nie sonnd must have been the
sanie, and seems w irnply thu many persona, and probably Quin-
tilian himself, employed d md 1 indifferently in writing the words
in question.

Securus (p. 2250) considers it z misuke to write the preposition
with ι 1, or the conjunctior· with ι d, proving that the imai-change
vens not unconimon Velius Longus (pp. ωηο, ²²³⁷) tells us that
ιο ινοίἀ confusion we ought to write the preposition ad md the
promenus id, quid, quod, su with a d, in order to disfinguish thern
from the oonjunetion at, the verbs ι”1 nnd quil, and the adverb quot,-
he maintains that apud ought ιο be written with a d, because no pr&
position ends with Ι, and became it munds better “propter nimiam
’runem exssitoteml' On the other lund, he holds that ,τεεί <night
to he written with a Ι, became no oonjuncfion ends with d, bnt admit-
ὼε( in pronunciation the mund of the final letter wan thu of d rather
than os 1, and tint therefore the question was whether ve should
write it u it was prononnoed, or promunce it as it was written.
