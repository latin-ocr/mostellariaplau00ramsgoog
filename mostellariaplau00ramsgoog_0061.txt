and Marius Victorin. (p. 2458), agree that we ought to write sed and
not set, because the word is an abbreviation of the ancient sedum.
The words of Victorinus are, “Antiqui pro sed, sedum scribebant, sed
quum nostra aetas partem literamm in eo reservarit, partem, brevitatis

causa, ex eo detraxerit, nonnullam immutarit, et nos per sed quam
per set scribamus;” where observe that he says scribamus, not scri·
bimus: a few lines before he had observed, “sed nos nunc et aduentum
et apud per D potius quam per T scribamus, amentum et aput.”
Again, the same Victorinus (p. 2462) derives haud from oi, and lays
it down as a rule that it ought to be written haud when the word
following begins with a vowel, as haud equidm, but haut when the
word following begins with a consonant, as haut placitura,· but this
must be regarded as an opinion of what ought to be done, not as
the record of an established usage. The forms laud and haut were
probably both in common use when Victorinus eomposed his treatise;
and he sought to establish a distinction as to their use. Ritschl
(Proleg. XCIX, C.), who has a pet theory of his own with regard to
the form hau, which may or may not have been occasionally em·
ployed,* reconstructs the above passage, and endeavours to convince
us that the precept which Victorinus intended to inculcate was that
we ought to write haud before a vowel andlan before a consonant.

But without attempting to penetrate farther into the thomy thicket
uf these grammatical speculations‚ it may be stated as a fact that the
forms At, Aput, Sci, Alibi, Haut, for Ad, Apud, Sed, Alaitd Haud, and
also It, Quid, Quot, for Id, Quia, Quod, occur not unfrequently in
inscriptions and the oldest MSS, and hence Bentley has admitted
Aput, Set, Haut, into the text of his Terence, while Ritschl adopts
these and also alric! and illut. But although it is certain that in later
times f was frequently substituted for d in many, if not all, of the ten
words above enumerated, the real question which we have now to
consider is whether there is any evidence to prove that this was the
case in the earlier period of the language. If we examine the whole
of the twenty inscriptions on which we chiefly rely, and even extend
our researches into the whole of those which are ranked in the great
work of Mommsen as belonging to an epoch anterior to the death
of Caesar, we shall arrive at the following result:

AD occurs upwards of ninety times ;

AT, never in the inscriptions 1- 20, but once in n. ra5a,an

* We find HAV' 1n an inscription, n. 1007, Mommsen, but the

original tablet has long since disappeared, and the reading of the word
is by no means certain.
