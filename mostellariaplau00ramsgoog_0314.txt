5. Agaln, adeo ul, like m ut, frequently refers to an object kept in
view, a design, ι purpose: Rud.v. iii. 31, dandum hue argeum est
probum, Id ego canthum hu1'c dabo, adeo ne ut hic emilia! manu, Le,
‘with the intent mats Stich. V. iv. 15. Atque adeo ul tu πῖνε ῥοπή,
fictum rgo tetum divido, ‘md with the intent that yon may be nble ιο
trust in my slncerity,' «ξας Aul. [ΙΙ. ii 27, Adeo ul tu mam sententiam
iam iam noscere porris, i⁴ e. 'to the intent that you may be able to
become acquainted sorthwith wilh my viewsl &c.; IV⁴ x. 8, Fateor
peccatam. et me culpam mmmmm ma, ld adea te oratum adnando
ul animo aequo ignoscas mz‘hi. The combination here is somewhat
more complicated, but this may be designed to express the confusion
and agitation os the speaker; the gener-al meaning is, ⁴1 have come
with the intention of entreating your forgiveness!

ΙΙΙ4 Adeo equivalent to eo moda, :a mirone, is used for the most part
with an explanatory force, ‘in that ways ‘thum' ‘such being the
case,¹ 'theresore,' ¹ then!

When adm is translated by ‘therefore' or by ‘thenf the former os
these is not to be regzrded as necessarily denoting a strict logical
deduction, nor the latter as denoting with emphasis a particular point
os tin-re, but both are used like the Greek οὖν ιο indicate n sequence
os evena, or the continuation os an action or os a nan-aive, as when
we say, ‘aster many dnngers therefore Hannibal descended from the
Alps into the plains os Italy: ‘let reason then ιι her own quarry fly,'
*we first leave childhood behind us, then youth, then the years os
ripened manhood, then' Ac. nm is properly nn adverb of place,
lhen os xime, but they are not unsrequently regarded as equivalenm
Thus in the Gospel ot* Str John, cap. ii. 18. the words ἀπεκρίθησα-
ιιῦ- ⁰1 Ἰουδαῖοι are translated in our authorized version, ‘then answered
the Jews and said nmo him,¹ but in Wielifl'e's Biblo, ‘thedor the
Jewis answerden and selden to bim5’ znd this brings us round ιο
what nmy be regarded ιε the original etymological meaning os adeo,
viz. adea, praeterea, ⁸ besides: ‘moreoven'

The meanings os adeo which belong to head ΠΙ, must he
illustrated by several examples, sor they have in many oues em-
barrassed lexicogmphers and commentators, and have led to useless
complications, or, not seldom. to the despair-ing remark, “adm
abundat‚'’ i. e. ‘mea-ns nothing ε’ Elxvid⁴ V. ii* 38, P. Dedin libn'msnas
