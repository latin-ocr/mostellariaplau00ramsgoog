have anticipated from the close, natural relation which subsists be·
tween these two labial mutes, in virtue os which they are constantly
interchanged, not only in cognate languages but iu different dialects
ol the same language‚ and even in different parts ol the same word
in the same dialect, as, lor instance, in nubo, nupsr',· scn'bo, smper)-
labor, lapsus, aud the like. The only Latin words which eud iub
are the prepositions ab, ob, sub. The connection oi ’ two oi these
with ἀπό audiri is obvious, and although no trustworthy examples
oi ap, op, or sup are supplied by inscriptions, it is certain that they
frequently took this sound in composition when prefixed to words
commencing with s orl.

Thus Quintil. 1.0. 1. vii. 7: ‘⁴ Quaeri solet, in scribendo
praepositiones, sonum, quem iunctae efficiunt, an, quem separatae,
observare conveniat; ut quum dico abitharii, secundam enim B
literam ratio poscit, aures magis audiunt P.''

As might have been expected, in the earlier iorms ol the language
the ear exercised greater influence than etymological considerations,
and we find in the inscriptions which we have enumerated above,
ap, op, and sup, sor ab, ob, sub, when these prepositions are com·
pounded with words beginning with s or t. Thus APSOLVTVS
[12 br's], OPSIDES [1], OPSIGNETVR [12], ΟΡΤΙΝΕΝΤ [17],
ΟΡΤΙΝΕΒΙΤ [12, 14, ro bz‘s]‚ OPTENVI [7], SVPslGNET,
SVPSIGNENT, SVPSIGNATO, SVPSIGlnetur), SVPSIGNA·
TVM, SVPSIAVO [14]. These instances are not very numerous,
but they are all in the same direction, and we find no example ol
any ol these prepositions retaining its proper shape before s or t
until we reach la, B.C. 49, which contains ABSOLVITO thrice;
and 20, B.C. 45, which has OPTEMPERETVR, and therefore we
may leel Justiiied in assuming that the practice prevailed during the
age os Plautus and long afterwards. We may safer extend the mle
to those cases in which the preposition abs enters into composition,
ior we find in inscriptions os a comparatively late date such sorrns
as APSTINERE, APSTINENTI, APSTVLIT, APSTVLERIT,
APSENS, APSENTI.

Numerous passages are to be found in the old grammariaus
bearing upon the relation subsisting between bs, ps, and the Greek
ψ, the sound os the latter not being aceruately represented by either
of the two former* so that Claudius, among other grammatica}

* Thus Priscian, p. 557, “multo molliorem et volubiliorem sonum

habet dquam ps vel bs . . . sicut ergo ψ melius sonat (qaam ps vel bs)
sic x etiam quam gs vel cs.- et x quidem assumpsimus, ψ autern non.”
