Moreover, iz will be found that much confusion prevaila in this por-
tion of the scene, and that vni-iens violem changes and mpoeitions
are necessary in order to maintain the system in iu integi-ity, Hence
obviously we may pronounce that there is iu reality no authority sor

The word supellex in the nominative ocem in Aul. 11. v. 17,

of which we may ndlzere to the quantity os supellex, as found iu
virgil, Propertius, Horace, and Juvenal, although some ol* the MSS.
and earlier editions, including the Vulgate, uuiformly write suppellex.
But two passages, in which the word eppears in oblique aves,
present a difficulty. In Ροειι. V. iii. 26 (Senar.) we have—

Taee atque parce mambri supellectili,-
and in Stich. 1. ii. 5 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

This being premised, if the two lines ae given above exhibit the

from the difficulty would be to sink the second syllable and to pro-

first example (Poen. V. iiL 2⁶), we may avoid all amburi-minent
by a simple transposition——

in the second (Stich. 1. ii. 5), the rhythrn οἶ which ir so harsh um
