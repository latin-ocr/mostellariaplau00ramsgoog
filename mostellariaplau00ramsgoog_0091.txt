predecessors had endeavoured to escape srom the difficulty by lol-
lowing one ol two paths—

r. Either by correcting. every passage in which they discovered
a. violation ol their own metrical canons, and in this way-to use
his own vigorous words-“ singulos fere versus miseris modis, ad·
dendo, mutilando, invertendo, contra Codicum fidem, iugulant et
trucidant ''-a description which applies very closely, not only to
the persons indicated by Bentley, but to many modern editors,
conspicuously to Bothe and Ritschl.

a. Or else they lay down the broad principle that wherever a word
occurs in Plautus and Terence, in which the quantity differs from
that exhibited by the same word in the epic and lyric writers, it must
be held that the dramatists merely represented the ordinary pro·
nunciation ol these words at the time when they wrote. Il this doctrine
be accepted in its full extent, it will supersede the necessity lor all
further inquiry, and we may freely make long syllables short, and
short syllables long, and at pleasure extend or curtail the natural
dimensions of words. Bentley, while reiecting this hypothesis as
untenable and even ridiculous, urges that il it were true we should
find at all events unllonnity os practice with regard to the same
words, while, on the contrary, it is notorious that the dramatists
sometimes observe the ordinary prosody, and sometimes deviate
from it, in the same word. Thus Ille, Esse, Propter, have the first
syllable invariably long in the later poets; in Plautus and Terence
they are apparently sometimes long and sometimm short.

Bentley then proceeds to propound his own views. He admits
that these departures from the ordinary rule must be regarded as
alieence-“ Licentia certe erat ; et titdgna sorte, cui Romuli nepotes
indulgerent”—but a lieence restricted within well-defined and nar·
row limita :-

1. That vowels naturally long are never shortened, but those only
which being naturally short become long by their position before two
consonants. According to this view, although matris from mater
could never have the first syllable short, sabailliaus from saltatlis might
have the second short This rule may be true, but the number of
examples is too limited to enable us to speak positively.

a. The number ol words which admit of such licences is small,
, and they are lor the most part monosyllables, dissyllables or com-
pounds of these with prepositions.

There is much truth in this observation, but the statement is not

sufficiently qualilied. lt will be seen, from the instances given,
