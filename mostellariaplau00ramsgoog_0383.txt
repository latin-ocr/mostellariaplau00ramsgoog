in Greece ior a day's work appears lrom Trin. lv, ii. r, quoted
above, p. 247.

There is another passage in Plautus which may throw some light
upon the subject; in Men. 111. iii. 17 Erotium's maid says to
Menaechmus, Amabo, nri Menaechme, inaurat da milei faciundas
medo mum numum, stalagmrb, ‘plesse Menaechmus dear, give the
jeveller (gold) to the weight ol two numi to make forme a pair ol
dropearrings! Il we suppose that 2 numm weighed two drachmae,
ie. about ¹32 or ¹33 Troy grains, the quantity here asked lor would
be appropriate, but the weight os a libella in silver, say six Troy grains,
would be greatly too small, and the weight ol a libella in oopper
absurdly large.

lt will be observed also that the gold Philippus weighed two Attic
Drachms, and hence the term numus denoting Didrachm was natu·
rally applied to each, the epithet aurem being employed to distinguish
the golden Didrachm lrorn the silver Didrachm.

There is still another consideration which, although hypothetical,
may possibly bear upon this question. No attempt to coin sdver
was made at Rome until 269 B.C. When we consider the stormy
and critical character of her history lor nearly a century alter that
date, it is not probable that the mint would be very active until the
spoils os lllacedonia and Asia were poured into the Treasury. Hence
during the lise ol Plautus the silver currency must have consisted
chiefly ol soreign coins, those in circulation among the Greeks oi
Magna Graecia and Sicily. But, judging lrom the medals which
have come down to modern times the Didrachm was more common
than any other piece in these regions, and vast numbers have been
preserved belonging to Tarentum, Velia, and Syracuse. These do
not, in most cases, exactly correspond to the weight ot' the Atrio
Didrachm, but Plautus might give the name ol numm or memus ar·
genti to the pieces with which he was most familiar.

We may now briefly recapitulate the different propositions which
we have endeavoured to prove.

r. The Numae ol Plautus, when the word is used to designate
a particular coin or specific sum, refers to the Greek monetary
system exclusively.

2. When the epithet aureus is added, or distinctly implied, it
denotes the Philippus. ’

3. When the epithet aureus is not expressed and not evidently
implied, then the simple numus, sometimes termed numus argente,
invariably represents a Greek Didrachm os silver.
