accomplished and attractive female slave seems to have varied lrom
ao to 60 minae. Thus Stratippocles, Epid. 1. i. 50, is represented
as having paid 40 minae lor a beautiful captive girl ; in the Cure. 1.
i. 63, Phaedromus complains of the leno who was the proprietor οἱ

iii. 65 she is represented as having been sold lor 30, with the addition
ol rosor her apparel and ornaments. In Merc. II. iii. 93, 20 minae
are spoken of as a reasonable price for a handsome female slave,
and 30 minae were paid by Philolaches lor Philematium, and by
Pleusidippus sor Palaestra, Rud. Prol. 45. The same price was fixed
lor the attractis-'e Pamphila in the Phormio, 111. iii. ²4· In Pseud,
1. i. 51, iii. 110, Phoenicium is represented as having been sold
sor 20 minae; and in Adel. 11. i. 37, IV. vii. 34, ao minae is the

believed by the purchaser to be a slave is sold without awarranty
sor 60 minae, the seller having at first asked roo: T uo peretulo sex-
aginta laec datur urgenti nunti. In Poen. IV. ii. 55, two little girIS,
one five, the other lour years old, were sold to a dealer by a Sicilian
pirate lor 18 minae (it seems doubtful whether the nutrix who was
sold along with them was included in the above sum). Phaedria tells
Thais, Eun. 1. ii. 89, that he gave 20 minae sor a little black girl
(ex Aethiopia anctllulam) and an eunuch, both ol which he had pre·
sented to her. As to men, Hegio (Cap. 11. ii. 103, iii. 4, 20) values
Philocrates whom he regards as a young able-bodied slave, at πο
minae; and in the same play we are told that a little boy was kid-
napped when four years old and sold lor 6 minae (Cap. V. ii. 21,
iii. a, iv. 15). In the As (1. iii. 77, Il. ii. 97) Cleaereta agrees to -
make over her daughter Philenium to Argyrippus exclusively lor one
year (hunc annum) sor 20 minae.
