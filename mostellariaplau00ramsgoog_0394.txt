EXCVRSVS XV.-SLA VE PUNISHMENTS. 261

Namella s. Nanellae seems to signify a combination of a collar
lor the neck with stoeks lor the leet. Similar contrivances were
employed lor confining cattle and doge. See Nonius (144), “Na-
mellae machinae genus ligneum ad discruciandos noxios paratum,
quo et collum et pedes inmittunt. Plautus Aulularia, nervas, catenas,
carcerem, numellas, pedicas, baras,'' where “ Aulularia '' is a mistalre
sor “Asinaria'' Paul. Diae. p. 171, ed. Mul, “Namella genus
vinculi quo quadrupedes deligantur.” See also Colum. R. R. VI.
19, VII. 8.

Baria. That this was a collar would he proved by a passage in
Pmdent. Psyehom. Praei. 33, atlrr'ta bee'e's colla, if we could depend

Α upon the text, but the reading is very doubtful. Plautus has a pun·

ning joke upon the word in Capt. IV. ii. 108, and it will be observed
that in the passage which we are discussing numellas, pedr‘cas, boras
are placed together.

Nervae s. Nervam is explained by Festus, p. 165, ed. blut:
“Il'eeuunr appellamus etiam ferreum vinculum quo pedes inpedi-
untur: quamquam Plautus eo etiam cervices vinciri ait perfidiose
captus eo epol nerva cerateas probal.” The word occurs again in Aul.

IV. x. 13, Capt. 111. v. 71, Curc. V. iii. 12, 40, 45, Poen. V. iv. 99, ·

Rud. 111. vi. 34, 38, 51. In the last there seems to be a direct
reference to the neck: Credo aliane in althea beluam hominem vertier,
Illic in columbane, creda, leno vartrlur, Nam r'n columbari callum haud
multo pest err'l, ln nervon ille hadre nidamenta congerel,· where calant-
bare must mean a collar, and is introduced in connection with
columbus in consequence ol its resemblance to calendariam. In
many passages nervae is equivalent to a chain, hence may signily
a⁵ prison, and this may be the meaning in the line just quoted. ef.
Curc. V. iii. 40. In Phor. 11. ii. ro the expression Onr'rfhrtr‘s atque
ame'casl nerunt hac saepe, Phormio, Vereor, ne r‘staecfarte'lado ἐκ nervom
erumpat denique, seems to be equivalent to our ‘should corne to
grief.' In the same play, IV. iv. 15, In nervam patriar ibit probably
means ‘he will go to gaol first! It would appear that the original
meaning ol nervus or nervam, which is probably identical with the
Greek νεῦρον, was not, as lexicographers insist, ‘a muscle' or ‘sinews
or ‘tendon‚' but ‘a thong or strap made ol hide,' and hence ‘a
cord' or ‘string,' the anatomical application being figurative and
secondary. In all the oldest Latin writers it is generally equivalent
to vinula, either in the sense ol a collar, or of bonds, or os a place
oi confinement. In the Laws oi the XII. Tables, as quoted by
Aul. Gell. XX. r, with regard to insolvent debtors, the creditor is ἱ
