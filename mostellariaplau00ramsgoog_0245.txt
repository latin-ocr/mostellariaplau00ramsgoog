112 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

i. e. ‘all kinds of fish5' and from Turpilius, si stabat Aquilo aut
Auster inopia tum erat piscati, i. e. ‘there was a scarcity of fish’ We
,may remark that we use the word sthing in adouble sense in
English, when we say ‘he is gone a·fishing,' and ‘he has hada
good fishing.' meaning ‘a good haul of fish3' but we cannot with
any accuracy employ the word fishr'ng to denote the ‘fish captured.

66. 1111111] The verse requires that the penultimate should here
be short, and hence the verb is opticen but in Ill. ii. 151 (150),
aptuere from aptatam· and in III. ii. 154, optantem· and so again in
Amph. ΙΙΙ. ii. 19; aptuere in Bac. IV. iv. 18, but the text and scansion
of the line are doubtfpl3 aptaretur, Mil. IV. vi. 56. The simple 1111
11 11 the received text of Trin. lll. ii· 81, Etrhm ob stultitiam tuam
te tuarrit multam 1111111111, where tueris is an anapaest; and in Lucret
IV. 449, Omnia quae 11111111 fieri tum bina tuendo,· and again IV. 361.
So cantui is found below lll. ii. 152 (151), and 111Α1. Ι. i. 111,
111. i. ²03 contuor, As. II. iii. 13, Pers. ΙΙ.11.16; intuor, Most 111.
ii. 150 (149); intuear, Rud. II. iv.·28; rirtuetur, Capt. llI. iv. 15,
Truc. 11. vii. 4ο; 1111111111, Β11. V. 11.11; intueri, Truc. l. ii. 583
1111111111, Eun. lll. v. 32; rirtuitur, Heaut. lI. iv. 13. Festus, although
his text is here imperfect, seems distinctly to recognise the double
form, tuor and tuear, and says that when he wrote they were used
indifferently; but we find nothing in the old writers to support his
notion that tuor originally was equivalent to viiito and tuear to aptanda.
See Fest. and Paul. Diac. pp. 354, 355, ed. Mtlll.

67. G. Pal tibi iituc creda nomen actutum sore. Τ. Dum 11111111

73. Sati'n 11111] Satria is frequently employed by Plautus, not
merely as a simple interrogative, but also to express strong emotion,
anxiety‚ surprise, and indignation. lt is used both alone and also in
combination with ut and si. We shall give examples, explaining as
we go along. 1. Simple interrogation: Stich. IV. 1. 13, Sed satin
ego tecum perdicatur sum, Antipho? i. e. ‘have I made my peace with
you sufficiently l' Most. Ι. iii. 10, Contempta, 1111111111 Scapha, ,111111
