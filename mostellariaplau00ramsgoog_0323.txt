pacto, nil etiem scih, ‘l will not shrink from my engagement, and (yet
with reference to) that which at this present moment I know will as·
suredly come to pass, l do not know at this present moment (as yet)
how I shall bring it about! Such seems to be the meaning of this
difficolt passage. The first of the two lines appears under a different
form in almost every different edition. We have inserted quod, with·
out which the line cannot be scanned, but in other respects have
adhered to the best tiss, which do not exhibit any variation.

2. ‘Even now’ with a negative, ‘as yet,’ ‘up to this time ;’ Pe'rs 1.
iii. 48, Numquam edepol quoiquam elram alendam dedi, ‘never as yet,'
‘never up to this time have I’ dte. ; lI. ii. 49, Sophoclidisca says to
the boy Paegnium, Tu quedem haud eleum es octogiuta pendo, ‘not yet do
you weigh six stones 3’ lV. iv. 4, Toxilus having asked Dordalus if he
had not been struck by the wisdom displayed by the maiden as soon
as she opened her mouth, the leno replies coolly, Haud potui etaiam
in primo uerbo perspicere supe'enlrbm, ‘l have not been able as yet, on
hearing the first word she uttered, clearly to discem her wisdom!
Sometimes, to make the meaning more clear and emphatic, adhuc is
added: thus Amph. l. i. 92, lllemquum eleum quicquam adhuc verborum
es! prolocutus perpeterere, ‘not one word even now (as yet) up to the
present moment has he uttered contrary to tnrth!

3. ‘Even now,' implying that an action is continued without inter-
ruption. This is distinctly expressed in Amph. Il. i. 21, Regesne,
improbe, eleum qui ludos sacis nee? ‘you who are even now (still)
making garne of me,' ‘continuing to make game of me ;’ in l. i. 213,
lllercury says to Sosia, A! nunlr'rei etrum, ‘you are lying even now,’
‘you are continuing to tell falsehoods,' having previously said compos
selei neendacei's advcnr'sle',· As. V. ii. 7 3, A! eleum cuba! cuculus! Surge,

prating here ever so long! ‘There’s no mistake about that, and you
are doing so even now,' ‘you are continuing to prate ;' Bac. IV. iv.
93, Μ. loquere porro. C. Adscribe dunt. M. Etiam loquere, where
eleum loquere is the same as loquere porro, ‘go on,' ‘continua’ Other
examples of eleum in this sense may be found in Amph. Ι. i. 2²53 As.
ΙΙ. ii. 61; Capt. lIl. iv. 24 ; Curc. 1. iii. 403 Men. lV. iii. 23, V. i. 103 ι
lllerc. lV. iv. ²3 ; lllil. Ill. i. 45 ; Pers. V. ii. 46 3 Trin. Il. iv. 171.

Eleum implies addition in such combinations as the following:
