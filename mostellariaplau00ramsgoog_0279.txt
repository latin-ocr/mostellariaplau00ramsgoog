146 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

valeatne ostrum l Po. Bellissumum hercle ordi et taciturm'ssumum, Num·
quam ullum verbum mutel, quom aperitur, tacet ‚· Quomque ella noctu
clanculum ad me exst, tacet‚· and at the end of the same scene, o. 93,
Vtile! at operriuntur aedes seste'orssumae! Non muts't cardo. Est hprdus.
P. Quoia das waiam? and again in the same play, 1. iii. 1, Placide
egredere, et sonuum prohibe sorum, et crepitum cardinum· and Trin V. ·
i. 8, sed fores Hae som'tu suo milti moram emerant riscommode. Some
ol the older commentators however imagine that the doors ol the
dwelling houses opened outwards directly upon the street, so that
every one who issued lorth rattled the door before opening it, in
order to give warning to passers by. According to this view, when,
in o. 75, Tranio is endeavouring to lrighten Theuropides and to
make him believe that the outraged ghost is about to sally sorth, he
exclaims, Concrepus'tsorssl Hs'ccine percussit? i. e. ‘the door rattlesi
κ was it he (the ghost) who smote on it l'
⁸ 4²· Sermonem nostrum qui aucupet] Plautus is lond ol the meta·
pbor derived lrom the watchsul stillness and artifices ol a bird-catcher 3
so As. V. ii. 31, Aucupemus ex obsidiis clanculum quam rem gerant ,·
Mil. lv. i. 43, Vr‘den tu illam oaslss venaturam facere, atque aucupium
auridum· so ii. 5; Men. lv. i. 12, Huc concedamus: ex obssiisi's aucupa·
Rud. IV. iv. 49, Vallem scelestus ut aumpatur, ‘is playing off his tures ;'
Truc. V. 72, Lepide mecastor aucupavi, ‘I have had capital sport'

44. Caprtalss caedri stacta est] i. e. ‘an atrocious murder was

, committed] Caedes is ¹another lorm ol the more common nomi-

native coeales, as we find aedos lor aedes, torquis lor torques, and canos
and canes. The epithet capitales is emphatic, since caedes or caedes

would not, taken alone, necessarily imply murder. Young scholars ,

are apt to be embarrassed by the word eupetalos. As there is awant
ol distinctness in some even of our best dictionaries in regard to the
modifications ol meaning assumed by this word, and their connection
with each other, we shall say a lew words on the subject. Caput
signifies* (1) ‘the head! (a) The head being regarded by many
ancient physiologists as the seat ol the vital principle, Caput denoted
‘the life! (3) Caput was used by the jurists to designate ‘the poli·
sicat life' ol a Roman citizen, and comprehended the whole amount
ol his privileges as a sree man, as amember ol a family, and asa
co'oss optimo oure. Hence when an individual from any cause suffered
the loss os these privileges, or ol any portion of them, he was said ·

*We notice here those leading meanings only of caput which are

cliffessa‘sy lor our present purpose. For others see notes on 1. iii. 54,
.1. ο.
