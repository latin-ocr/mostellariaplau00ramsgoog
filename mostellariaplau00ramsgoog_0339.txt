&a ς Poen. V. iii. 1, G. Quis pultat? M. Que'te proxumus ese. G. Quid
uisi M. Em Nouiste'rt tu t'llunc tenuatum hemr‘rteru, qui siet? G. Nam
quem ego adspicio! Prole supreme luprierl here great wonder is
expressed, ‘can I believe my eyesl Iam amazed‚ ior whom do 1
seei’ ’

II. Em'm. Enim is more common under such circumstances, and
this use of the word has, in very many cases, been overlooked by
commentatore, who, in such examples as those which follow, assert
that ent'rn is equivalent to enain uero, assuming that enim vero is equi·
valent to the simple vere, and may signisy merely ‘truly' or ‘indeed'
being little better than an expletive. But we maintain thatin the
earlier writers enr'rn uero always signifies ‘for in truth,' as creir always
signifies ‘lor‚' and that both are uniformly employed to introduce an
explanation. Frequently the blank is very easily supplied, an affirma·
tion or negation only being suppressed: thus Pers. 11. v. 16, S. Qum
boves beiti hic sunl in crumena. T. Emtite sodes, ne enices same, saite
ire pastum. S. Enim metuo ut possem e'rt debilem reicere ne vagentur,
‘nay, not s0, lor 1 am afraid that I shall not be able to drive them
back again to their stall, and that they will stray ;’ Most. 111. iii. 23
(IV. ii. a 3), Tn. Quia tibi umquam quiequam, postquam tutet sum, oer-
borum dedi! Tu. Ego ene‘rn caui recte, ‘no, you have not, for I have
been well on my guard!

Sometimes the suppressed clause is less simple, but, in general, it
may be very easily deduced lrotn the context: thus Epid. V. i. 41,
S. Accipe argentum hoc, Danista: lui suni quadragesi meitue, St'qus'd
erit dubium immutabo. D. Beneseceiti: bene vale. S. Nunc ene'ru tu
mea es: here, in all probability, the emin is explanatory ol an action
or gesture-Stratippocles having pald the money proceeds to lay
hold ol the slave whom he had purchased, and upon her shrinking
back he exclaims‚ ‘I have a right to take possession os you, ior you
are now my property ;' Bac. IV. iv. 51, M. Nunc quid nos uusocerei
C. Em'ne nehel, urii ut ametis mpero: ‘Now what do you want us to
do i’ ‘Be easy as to that, ior I bid you do nothing except' dec Cas.
11.iv.1, S. Qut illum Di omnes Deaeque perdant! C. Te uxor urebar
tuo Me uocare. S. Ego em'rn uocari rasse} ‘she said truly, lorI ordered
you to be called ;’ Pers. IV. iv. 59, T. Sequere me: adduco hunc, εἰ
quid svs ea· leuc percontarier. D. Enim volo te adesse, ‘by all means
will I question her now, lor I wish you to be present ;' Most. V. ii.

ιι (iii. 11), Tu. Verbere, rhum curtiles? Τιι, Que'on’ nte pro te t're ad
cenam autunto? Τ 11. Non enim tie's, ego serore saxo, ut meruisti, in
crucem, ‘you need say nothing about going to supper, you shall not
