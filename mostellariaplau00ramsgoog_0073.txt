lvi PROLEGOMENA.

Spondee and the Anapaest from the 4th place, but Hermann, while
he admits the canon when the division oi the verse is observed,
considers that when the division is not observed‚ the Spondee, the
Anapaest, and even the Dactyl, are all admissible.

In so tar as the yth toot is concerned, the Latina admit freely
the proper toot, the Tribrach, the Spondee, and the Dactyl, the Ana-
paest more rarely, and generally include it in a single word.

Finally, this verse is Asynartete, and therefore the last syllable of
the 4th soot may be either long or short, and the hiatus in this
place is freely permitted.

Acoording to what has been said above, the scheme oi the lambio
Tetr. Cat. will be as follows :-

„..ae

V ·· νυ·ιυυ·1υυ·υυ· {VU··}
νυ “Vbii-Vh! -vv -υυ ’vv

We shall give a lew specimens to illustrate the varieties ot struc-
ture indicated above, selecting our examples from the Mostellaria,
in which the lines at the commencement oi 1. iii. (1-90) are com·
posed in this measure :-

Iampridem ecastarsragr'da Ι non lavi magi ' lubenter.
v. a, Asynartete, and Spondee in yth,
Nec quam me melma, mea Scapha, ΙΙ rear esse defaecatam.
