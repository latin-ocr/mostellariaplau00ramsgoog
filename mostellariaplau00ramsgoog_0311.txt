178 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

generally inaccrescit, ‘to that was added? So eodem may mean
‘to the same place’ and ‘to the same person!

Since ιο may signify ‘to that place,' the place may, in certain
cases, be regarded as the extreme point or limit of progression, and
hence, when followed by ut, it frequently signifies ‘to that (such a)
point,' ‘to that (such a) pitch,' ‘to that (such an) extent,’ δια, as in
the phrases, urbs ιο crevit uf magnetudr'nc laboret sua, ‘the city has
increased to that point,' or ‘to such an extent ;' ιο rem adducam ut,
dcc, ‘I will bring the matter to that (such a) point ;’ ιο suroris
processc't, ‘be advanced to that point (such a pitch) of phrenzy,' tec.

From the idea of moving or travelling towards acertain place or
point, the transitionis easy to the notion of ‘keeping an object in
view! Hence, figuratively, ιο denotes the direction in which the
thoughts or actions move, and hence ‘a purpose, ‘an intention,’ ‘a
design,' being in this case followed ογ quo, ut, ne, quc'n, or the lite.
This is clearly brought out in the expressions-co scripsi quo plus
auctoretatis haberem-fcinus ad fc ιο mc'sa' uf—eo te non interpellani
ne-non ιο Ιιοι dc‘co quinquae tu οίι ego velim effaetam lubens. So
eodem signifies ‘to the same purpose' in the phrase eodem pertenere.

II. Eo signifying ‘by that! When we read in Livy—Nocte ct nzc'ttc-
bantur e! perumz'ebant: ιο cmtodias hostticm fallebant-eo signifies ‘by
that,' ‘by that mode of procedure,’ ‘by doing that,’ and it serves to
explain a previous statement. Hence ιο is frequently equivalent to
‘thus' or hoc modo, ‘for this reason,' ‘therefore ς’ and when Cicero
says, frater es, ιο vercor, ιο is explanatory, and means ‘for that
reason,’ ‘therefore ;' and again, dederam traduc ante literas cd tc, ιο
ero breocbr. So ιο when joined with a comparative signifies ‘by that'
in the sense of tanto-eo gravior cs! dolor, quo culpa mac'or-and so

contagii, eominus, ‘by that (so much) the more,' ‘by that (so much) ’

the less!

This being premised with regard to ιο, it will be found, as might
bave been expected, that adeo resembles it very closely in meaning,
indeed, in many cases, ιο might be substituted sotadeo and vice versa,
without the sense being perceptibly changed The different meanings
of οιίιο may be ranged under three heads.

1. Adeo equivalent to praeterea, and signifying simply ‘in addition
to that!

ll. Adeo signifying ‘up to that point'

Ill. Adeo signifying ‘thus,’ ‘in that way,’ ‘therefore'

We shall select some of the most striking examples of the
multifarious meanings ascribed by Freund and others to adeo, and
