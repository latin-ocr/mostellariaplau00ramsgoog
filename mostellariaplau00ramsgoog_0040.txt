111. Inscnph'ousr

By su the most relinhle nnd authorimive evidence on questions
os early Latin orthognphy is nfforded by inscriptions. The only
sources of sallncy, in so iar as inscriptions are conoemed, may be
classed under smu- heads:

1. The mistaken made by the original engnvem on the utone or
meta-L

π, The mistaheu made by the scholas who hnve nauso-iberi
them.

3. The difficulty os memini-ag the exact period nt which they
were engnved.

4. The genuineness of the inscriptions themselves.

The mistakes made by the engnvers ιη sm· the most put obvious,
are not numerous, and but few os them meet the questions under
consideration.

The grett cm taken :nd ueniens made by modern scholars to
ari-ive at perfect που-κγ in representing the originnlz, has in n great
meum-e removed any difficulties which might have embanmed one
from this qunrter. stin the neoeusity of cue is rendered obvious by
the errore pointed out, md the corrections introduced by eneh new
copyist, md the difficulty of nrriving at absolute πεπυ-κγ is proved
by the vanatims—uifling it is true, but sun vatianum—presented in
nlmort all the different editions os the inscription on the tornb ol·
the Scipion. So also intranscfibing from the original capitals into
ordinary type, the eye and hand, however practised, will some*

In the mse of almost nll the inscriptions we have selected and
enumernted below, the date is clearly asceruined, within very narrow
