but it is more simple to make neutiquam hut a Spondee.' The hest
MSS. have et et instead of tet, but this does not affect the scansion.
Poen. 1. i. ’μ (Sesea),

St'rte darnuo stagno quae elui mutauere potest,
where neutiquam must be adissyllable. These are the whole ol the
examples in the Delphin index, and the same are given in the index
ol W, preceded by the remark ‘⁶ neutiquam prima correpta” 1 think
1 am justified in asserting that neutt‘quam is unilormly a dissyllable.
Now lor neuter. Merc. 111. i. 40 (lamb. Tetr. Cat), ·
Neuter struprt' casua caput trituret-Di thneortalest ‚

where muteris a Spondee. Neuter is found also in Cas. V. iv. 3²
and Stich. V. iv. 51, but in both these passages the text ls so
uncertain that nothing can be founded on it. ln Sustulit 84
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Certumne est, neutram vostrarum persequi rutpertum putres?
neutram is a Spondee; so also in Mil. 11. v. 18 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), ’
Et tu et hei-Nou uos noveih't-Neutrau-Metuo mausum

Rud. III. vi. 16 (senaa),
Vtrum ve's, opta, dum licut-Neutrum vota·

and Frag. Vidular.6 (apparently lamb. Tetr. Acat),

Ego servabo, quast· sequestro detis: neutri reddito ustum.
In hul. ΙΙ. ii. 56 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Neutrubi trabeam stubt'te stabulum, si quid dehorte‘suut
neutrub’ is a Trochee, as also in Men. V. ii. 35 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Vt caveres neuter ad me e'rett's curu quertlnoue'a.

In every case, therefore, in which neuter occure, ueuter may be
naturally scanned as a dissyllable and Spondee.

Amator. Weise quotes as examples ol amator with the first long,
Cas. 111. iii. a (senat),

Hominem amtorem utlum adsuunt pruedere,

where surely it is quite as good to make the rst loot a Tribrach as
an Anapaest ; again, Epid 11. ii. 30 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), μ

Obviam ornatae occurrebant, s’e'e‘ts quaeque umatortbtu,

where it is better to leave a hiatus alter quaeque than to' lengthen ciue.

(It will be observed tharisii must be pronounced as a monosyllable.)
So in Merc. Prol. 4 (Senta),
