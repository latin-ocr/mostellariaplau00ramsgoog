METRE AND PROSODY. lxvii

be long οι short at pleasure, and a hiatus may be treely admitted;
thus Cas. 11. ii. 29,
Quin otro ant suptrahat ΙΙ aut stupro invenerit·
and o. 16,
Nec nili ius neuen ΙΙ optinendi optio est,-
and Rutl IV. iii. ιι,
Sed boni consili ΙΙ ecquid in te mihi est,·

where suptrahat, ias mun, and consili, although each is followedby

avowel, stand for Cretics‚ In so far as the hiatus is concemed, we

may remark that it is not unicequently neglected in other parts ol
v .

ὼεΤὶῗιηκῐξοῦοιιίιιις passage will afford a good example ol the Cretic

Tetrameter Acat.; it is from Cas. 111. v. 1-

anla sum, nulla sunit Terra, tota occt'dit

Cor netu mortuom est: membra miserae* tremunt,
Nescio unde auxili, praesidi, perfugi

Mi, aut opum copiam comparem aut expetant:
Tanta sactes modo mc'ra neris nodis

Intu' vidi, manc atque integram audaciam.
Cooc† tibi, Cleostrata :l apscede ab r'sta, opsecro,
Ne quid in te nali faxit ital percita.

The Cretic Tetrameter Catalectic occurs here and there in detached
lines. Hermann arranges seven in succession in Trin.11.i. 17-23,
but several of these cannot be scanned without conjectural emenda·
tions; one presents no difficulty, and may serve as an example—

Da mahiloc, mel meum, si ene anas, si audes,·

see also what is said below on Most. 1. iv.

Crctc'cs combined with T rockccs.

Lines are occasionally sound in Plautus which belong unquestionably
to the class os Cretics‚ but which terminate in a peculias manna.

* Fourth Paeon in 3rd place, unless we pronounce mistae.

† Cave, a monosyllable, pronounced Can.

1 Cleostrata, a trisyllable‚ pronounced Clostrata.

§ Fourth Paeon in 3rd place. lta is a conjectural emendation, tor the
Mss, have ira, but itis not satisfactory. The next line, which concludes
the speech of Pardalisca, secam to be a Choriambic Tetrameter hcet,-

Eripite isti gladium c soi est impos animi.
