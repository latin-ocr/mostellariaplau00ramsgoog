EXCVRSVS xxv.-TAI,ENTVM MlNA, ὧι. 247

minae ιιι-ε paid over, two mi are deducted aa the vali-e of the bag
(ummah in Men. 1. iv> ¹ Dudum gives Cylindms three mi to
purchase vinnds sor a prandium: in Trin, lv. ii. ι the Syoophnnta
says, Huic ‘ga diei nomen trihumsaa'am, nan teo operam meam Tribur
numi.» hodie Ioeaw'ad arles maburtius, with which coqipare vv. ⁶, ¹⁵3·
The possage in Most. 11. i. ιο vin be examined below.

There is nothing in any of the ebove examples from which we
could with ceruimy inser the precise varue os the Nun-ue. Some
light however is thrown upon the inquiry by the speech os the cook,
in Pseud. 111. ii. ιο, who comphins that when people went ιο the
mmet ιο hire a cook, they looked ont not for the best :rtiste bnt
for the cheapest: hence, he exclaims, Hoc ego sul hodie solus opsessor
sori, Illi drachmis· isso! uiuri, me mmo pole-xl M'noris quitquam
’iuml' ul surgam subigere cf. Aul. 111. ii. 34, Pseud. 11L ii. 58, 87.
This proves oonclusively that the Nauius was more in vniue than the
Drachma. But we can go suthem in Truc. ΙΙ. ἰν. 91 Dinarchus
declares that he wiu expend a Mina on viantis for Phronesium,
Praeterea apa-mari diatritam! ad athan, and in vii. ιι, ὕεα, who
had been employed ιο lay out the money, gives, in a soliloquy, an
account os his stewardship, rejoicing thzt he had not suiled to take
good care of himself, Nam iam de hoc φωνὴ de mna una demt'raui'
Mada quinque numos. num· dmm- param Herculaneum. But the
Pars Herculanea (see note on Most. IV. iii. 45) m a ἀὼς, there-
fore five numi were one-tenth os a Mina, and since a Min2=1w
Drmhmae, five numi must have been equa} to ιο Brachium, and
hence a Numa-x was :qual to two Bramme or a DMraehn.

This vulne of the Numa: will suit perieetly the passages quoted
zbove, und dione also in which considerable sums are mentioned.
In RurL V. iii. ⁵⁰ Labrax says that he paid a thousand Num* (mille
numos denua-eram) for Ampelisca, but according to the above com-
putntion ιοοο Numi would be ιο Minae, which was m ordimry
price sor a semele slave <see note on Mose Ι. iii. ¹42), end so ⁶00
Numi, or n imme, is the price os a female slave os nn inferior
description in Pers. 1. i. 37, iii, 37, 111⁴ iii. ζμ, V. ii. 7ο, lilith
numos is round in Rud. V. ii. 40, where the context proves thar the
sum was considerably less than a taicum and mille numum occurs in
Mero 11. iv. ²3, but here the context does not enable us ω fix even
an approximate value for the amount indicated.

⁸ ln Mem. ιν. iv. ³⁷ ι took demands a dueum: a hi: mre for ι day.
† 11 is almost unnecefflry to observa tim the erpo-ration given by some
of the older comme-imon “numo nureo Rom-no is :laomim nbsurd.
