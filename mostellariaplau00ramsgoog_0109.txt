transcribet, who was not acquainted with supellectiles as a form of
the nominative.

Trapezila. Goeller, Lindemann, and Ritschl would allow the
second syllable in Trapeaila to be short, on the authority of Trin. 11.
iv. 23 (Senam), ¹

Trapezilae mille drachumarum Olympicum,

in which they suppose the first foot to be an Anapaest. B has
drachumarm· C, D, E, draheumarum,· but Α has the common
form drachmarum. But although the first syllable in drachma must
be long, it by no means follows that the first syllable in drachuma
is also long; on the contrary, we should be justified in asserting
that it maest be short, for the Greelr δραχμὴ is naturally short, and
accordingly being followedby the aspiratcd mute χ and the liquid μ
appears as short in Aristop. Plut, 884,
Τὸν δακτύλων foedi παρ’ Εὐδάμου δρᾶχμῆς.

Hence all difficulty as to the scansion of the above line vanishes, and
it is unnecessary to have recourse to the expedient of pronouncing
malle as amonosyllable. In other passages of Plautus trapezita has
uniformly its proper quantity, e. g. Asin. II. iv. 32, Capt 1. ii. 90,
11. iii 89, Cure. 11. iii. 62, 66, ΙΙΙ. 36, 50, IV. iv. 3, V. ii. ao,
iii. 34, 43, Pseud. II. iv. 67.

Philippus, philippens, Philippicas. The case of these words is
peculiar, and demands special notice. They occur upwards of
thirty times in Plautus with reference to gold coin, and in every
instance, except perhaps one, to be noticed below, the two first
syllables are to be pronounced as one—Phlippus, Phlippeus. (Phi-
lippeus however does not occur in nominative sing.) This cannot
be occidental, but must have resultcd from the ordinary pronun·
clation of the word, for the form Philippus would be quite as ser-
viceable in an Iambic or Trochaic line as Phlr'ppus. Again, Phr’lppeus,
Philippeo, Philippei, lec, seem sometimes pronounced as trisyllables,
Phhppiirs, ac, but more frequently as dissyllables, PhlippeTs, lec,
never as tetrasyllables, Philippiis. Phrlppicum occurs once only,
and must be pronounced Phlippicum. Thus Poen. 1. iii. 6 (senaa),

Trecentos Plffppos Colluhrsco vrllr'co,·
Bac. IV. ix. 83 (Sanan),
Pol haud derides, nam dueenh‘s eureis
