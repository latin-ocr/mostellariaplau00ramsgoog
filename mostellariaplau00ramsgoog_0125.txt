cviii PROLEGOMENA.

with the first short, or pronounced ‘correptim' seems to rest upon
Stich. l. 111. 60. The following are additional examples from the
index of W.: Mero. 1. ii. 9 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), a line which in the
MSS. is conupt; Men. V. ix. 31, where also the reading is uncer-
tain, but without departiug a hair-breadth from the MSS. we bave—

Quam bic tui est, tuque haim autem postea eandem petralem
ac patrem.

R. has poste, but postya ean forms a Spondee. The last example
quoted is from Rud 111. iv. aa,

Haerentem Veneri complanarent-Habeat, si argentum dabri,

on which W. has the note, “Hae non elidendum, auum vero corri-
piendum priori syllaba, quasi Hae uteml’ It seems positively perverse
to go out of the straight path in search, as it were, of a difficulty.
Elide hae before auum, and the scansion is simple and obvious.

Ergo is another of those words in which it is supposed that we
may occasionally pronounce the first syllable short, or the whole
word ‘correptim' Lind says, “De ergo correptim pronunciata nou
dubitatum est, quamquam rara sunt exempla, veluti Mil. IV. ii. ¹7·”
The following are quoted as examples: Mil. IV. ii. 17 (Troch. Tetr. ‘
Cat),

Ego hanc contritae uxorem ducam-Qui! ergo hanc debrias
conloqui? ,
So the MSS, except that B has Quid ergo hac, which would make
no differenee in the scansion. The difficulty here however is not
confined to ergo, but we must maire either aTrochee or aSpondee
out of Ego hanc conltz'nuo. R. corrects—

Ego continuo uxorem hanc ducam—Ergo hanc quid, dc.

Agant, quid ergo at the commencement oi 1 Troch. Tetr. Cat,
Men. 11. iii. 79, occurs in a corrupt passage. Ergo is not found in
any of the best MSS, and in any case the quid is probably the
word curtailed in the pronunciation. So Trin. IV. ii. 81 (Troch.
Tetr. Cat),

Ne male loquere apsenti amt'co- Quid ergo ille rgnavissumm.

So the MSS.; Reiz. and 1.,0111111 ergo. Pers.I.i. 16 is called
aTroch. Tetr. Cat, but it cannot be scanned as such without the
omission of a word, and here again we have quid ergo. ln Pers. 11.

ii. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), we have again quid ergo. Stich. V. iv. 45
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),
