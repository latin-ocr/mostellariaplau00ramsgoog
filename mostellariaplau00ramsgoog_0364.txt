that the person spoken of is merely ‘good of his kinds as Poen. V.
iii. 6, Praesteguator bic quedem Poenus probus est, ‘this Carthaginien
is a capital juggler3' and Most. 1. iii. 86, Oh probus bomo sum, Quae
pro me eausam diceretpatronum liberavi, ‘I am alrnowing fellov!

Probus, when applied to inanimate objecto, denotes that they are
‘good of their kind ε’ thus Most. 111. ii. 41, Vinu et vectu piscatu probo
electili,· and Rud 111. v. 19, D. I dum, Turbale'o, curre‘crelo adfer buc
foras Duas clavas. L. choas? D. Sed probas, ‘but see that they
are good (stout) ones!

Probe, the adverb, is applied to any act or worlr performed in a
satisfactory manner: Most 1. ii. 19 (18), Factae (sc. aedes) probe,
examussim, ie. 'vell-constructed ς’ so Men. 111. ii. 1, Potin at
quiescas, si ego tibi bane (sc. pallam) bode'e probe [praeque eoncirmatam
reseram temperi? again, As. IV. i. 10, serebas oe'ele plane et probe,
‘see that you write it distinctly and correctly3' and Most. 111. ii. 47,
Nos prosecta probe, ut voluimus, ornemus, ‘we have lived well,’ that is,
‘lived apleasant life ς’ and in the same play, 1. iv. 29, Probe quin amabo
accubas, Delphium mea, ‘place yourself comfortably-at your ease!

There is however a modification of the meaning of probe which
deserves especial notice, since it occurs very frequently in the
dramatists It is employed to denote that an action has been or
will be performed completely and in tle best manner, while the action
itself may 01 may not be praiseworthy, and in this sense the force
of the word may frequently be correctly conveyed hy the English
‘thorougmyv uus Amph. 111. m. ιο, om· nc imperantem emar
esse, errant probe, ‘are thoroughly or completely mistalren3' so Trin.
ΠΙ. iii. 88, Eumque brer ad adulescentem medelotum probe Mittam,
‘thoroughly schooled ;' again, Most. I. i. 4, Ego pol te rure, si ocham,
ulciscar probe,· and V. i. 19 (ii. 4), Quoties ego bic ludeje‘cabo careium, si
veho, probe,· and Bac. 111. iii. 94, Aelsatem est, Mnesiloche, eura et con-
castiga bominem probe,· and Cas. l. 36, Ita te adgerunda curvom aqua
sacram probe, Vr postr'lena posn'l ex te fieri, ‘I will render you so

thoroughly croolred that a saddletree (frume of a paclrsaddle) may -

he made out of you ς’ so Bac. IV. iv. 50, Emungam bominem probe
bodri, ‘1 will hefool;' Most V. i. 59 (ii. 44), probe me emunxti,-
Trin. IV. ii. 51, ludam bominem probe,· Amph. 111. iv. 14, 22, saxo
probe eam bic uteorum and in the passage referred to from Capt.
11. ii. 19, usque admutilabit probe.

Plautus uses also the form adprobe in Trin. IV. ii. 115, Mihi con·
crederet, nisi me ille et ego ellum nossem adprobe, but it seems to be an
cin. hey. The word is mentioned by Aul. Gell. VII. 7.
