276 , PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

‘il l do not send you about your business after 1 have made you cut
a miserable figure! ln Pseud. 1. iii. 135 we have the phrase, to be
noticed again below, mam ludere, ‘to lose one's labour,' In pertusum
angeremus dr'cla dolium, operam ludriam and this in Rud. lV. i.9
appears under the form, Nam nune el operam ludossacit* el retra, ‘he
is losing his labour and spoiling his nets!

We must carelully distinguish the phrase ludas facere aliquem, ‘to
make a show ol a person,' lrom ludos faeere alr'eu1'‚† which properly
signifies ‘to exhibit games in honour ol oue deceased: and is used
by Plautus in the ironical sense, ‘to exhibit a spectacle lor the
amusement ol others in honour ol a living man, who is as powerless
in the hands oi the exhibitore as il he were a eorpse on the funeral
pyre! The origin ol the expression is clearly indicated in Most. 11.
i. 80, Ludos ego hodie vebo praesenti lrr'c reni F actam, quod credo morteto
numquam sore, ‘l will exhibit games in honour ol this old gentleman
alive and looking on-a distinction which, Ι lancy, will never be
accorded to him when dead 3' so Cas. IV. i. 1, Nec pol ego Numae
creda, neque ego Olumpeae, Neque usquam ludas lam scalellas fieri, Quam
hic entur fiunl Iudi ludificabiles Seni nostra, el nostro Olumpianim'llr'co;
and so Truc. IV. ii. 46, where Dinarchus exclaims, Iam hercle ego tr'be',
inlecebra, ludos sacram, clamare in aaa, he does not mean, ‘l will make
game ol you,’ or ‘I will make aiool ol you,' but says ironieally, ‘l
will make an exhibition in honour ol you by shouting out your name
in the public street* referring to the pipulum, which is sully explained
in the note on Most. 111. i. 59 (55).

We find the following couplet twice in Plautus, lllerc. Il. i. 1 and
Rud. Ill. i. r, llle'rra madri Di ludos faciunt homenibus, Minusque
exemplis somnia r'n sonrm‘s danunt. We must not suppose that the
speaker intends to say, ‘the Gods make sport of men,' that is,
‘bclool or deceive or hold them up to ridicule,’ which would by no
means accord with the heliel then prevalent with regard to dreams,
but, ‘aster a marvellous fashion do the Gods exhibit spectacles lor
men,’ that is, ‘lor the interest and instruction ol men, by waming
themoi coming events by strange appearances exhibited to them in
dreams! Observe that the lorms used by Plautus are invariably
ludas facere aliquem or ludas facere alt‘cut', never ludum, the phrases
being derived from ludi in the sense ol Public Spectacles 3 the only q

*Here the MSS. have ludos dat, but Priscian in quoting the passage
gives ludos jacit.

†Ritschl, Parerg. Plaut. l. p. 427·30‚ seems to regard thern as sy·
nonymous.
