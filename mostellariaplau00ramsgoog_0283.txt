shouldn't wonder ii that lellow were either a robber or aeut-purse.'
In Trin. 11. iv. 94, after Philto had been moralising upon the lot of
man, and declaring that rich and poor aiter they had passed into the
nether world were upon a complete equality as sar as wealth was con·
cerned, Stasimus, according to the Vulgate text, is made to say, lllr'rum
m' lu t'lluc tecum dabrhksfiras, which cannot be explained according to
the view we have given of nu'rum m'. But tite Milan Palimpsest gives
here Artutauuuuruw, and the Pall. MSS. (BCD) An mirum inim or an
mirum a'm' tu, while mirum ιιι· is found orily in the interpolated MSS.
and Ed. Prin. Hence there can be little doubt that R has restored
the true reading, Mirm quin tu illo tecum mathasseras, i. e. ‘it is very
likely, isn't it, that you could carry your riches to the other world,'-
a contemptuous sneer, which is quite appropriate and in character.
7ο. Desidit smepalmm clam] Clam and Palam are employed as
adverbs in the sense ol ‘secretly' and ‘openly,' and are osten directly
opposed to each other ; thus Mero. V. iv. 63, Si qm's protatumt plus
perdet cmm, quam si praehibuerit palam Clam is sometimes combined
with another adverb, as Poen. III. iii. 49, Aa mim hic clam furtim esse
uolt. Clam, moreover, is in very many passages used as a preposition
governing the accusative, or the ablative, or, more rarely, the genitive,
andin this case significa ‘without the knowledge of' or ‘concealed
irom the knowledge os;’ thus Cas. Prol. 51, Pater filiasque clam alter
alterum, ‘the one without the knowledge ol the other ;’ Most. V. i. 13,
Nam scta equidem nulla pacta ram esse posse clam semem, ‘that in no
way can the truth be concealed from ;' Mero. III. ii. a, with the abla-
tive, Empta est anu'ca clam uxore mea elfilia; Mero. Prol. 43, with the
genitive, Res exulabam ad allam ababa! clam palmi. So clam me, Cas.
1. i. 7, Rud. 1. ii. 45, Heaut. 1. i. 46, 66, Hec. 11. ii. ιο, ΙΙΙ. iv. ro,
IV. ii. 1; clam te, Andr. I. v. 52, Eun. IV. vii. 25, Hec. IV. iv. 59,
Phor. V. viii 15; clam illum, Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 26 ;, clam uxorem, As. 1v. ii.
6, Cas. Prol. 54, ΙΙ. viii. 15, 32; clam urium, Αιιιριι. ΡιοΙ. ιο7, Cas.
11. ii. 27. The choice oi case seems quite arbitrary, lor we have
clam uxorem and clam m'ro in the same sentence, Mero. IV. vi. 3, 5,
ιι, and no distinction ol meaning can be drawn between clam patrem,
Mero. 11. iii. 8; clam patre, Truc. 11. i. 37; and clam patris, Mero.
Prol. 43. Palam is not used as a preposition, but both clam and
¹palam, especially the latter, appear as indeclinable adjectives, signi· ,
ἰ’γίιις respectively ‘secret' and ‘evident’ or ‘open ;’ thus ridelli.
46, Dum id restrium iri credit, tantisper cavet: Si spera! sare clam,
rursm ad aagendam redit, i. e. ‘il' he hopes that what he does will be
secret ;' and hence facere aliquali palam signifies not ‘to do something
