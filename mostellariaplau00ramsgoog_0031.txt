xiv PROLEGOMENA.

0. The Codex aller ol Camerarius, frequently designated, since
the time ol Parcus, as the Codex Decurtatus.

On the death of Camerarius this MS. was purchased, along with
the Vetus Codex, and deposited in the Palatine Library; from thence
it was transferred to the Vatican; in 1797 it was carried to Paris,
and in 1815 restored to the Library at Heidelberg, where it now
remams.

lt belongs to the twellth century, and is written on 238 leaves ol
parchment in quarto. lt originally contained the whole twenty plays,
but the first eight have been torn off, and the last twelve alone remain.
It was executed by various hands, and the writing is by no means
elegant The division into words is more corrupt than in B; there
is no separation into lines except in a lew cases ‘in the Senarians.
The names ol the characters are generally inserted both at the com·
mencement of the scenes and in the changes in the dialogue, and
when omitted a space is usually leit blank lor their insertion.

The arrangement oi the plays is the same as in B.

D. The Codex Vatt'camcs, numbered 3870.

This has been proved to be the identical MS. brought to Italy in
1429byNicolas of Treves from Germany, and delivered to Cardinal
Orsini* conceming which we have spoken at length above.

It contains, in 308 sheets oi parchment, acemanecestriae,
Aulularr'a, about one-hali ol the Captivi, and the twelve last plays
entire.

It bears a very close resemblance to C, both in age, shape, writing,
and perverse distribution oi the metrical lines, but was written uni-
iorrnly bya single hand, and is somewhat less faulty in the division
nithe words.

Ε. The Codex Libitinam, belonging to the Bibliotheca Senatoria,
lt belongs to the lourteenth century, is written beautifully on 31⁴ sheets
of parchment in lolio, and contains the whole twenty plays. lt is
sometimes designated as the Codex Surriomar, in consequence oi
having, during a portion ol the sixteenth century, been in the pos·

session ol Hieronymus Surita‚ ol Saragossa It is regarded by R. as
presenting the interpolated text under its best form.

Lastly, we may mention z, the Edririr Princeps, edited by George
Merula, and printed at Venice in 1472.

[Hence called by R. ‘Ursinianurn.’-En.]
