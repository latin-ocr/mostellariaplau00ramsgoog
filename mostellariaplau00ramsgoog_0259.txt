so scelestus, ‘unluck‘y wretch that I am,' Rud. 111. v. 11; scelestius,
‘more unfortunate,' Men. 111. i. 1; scelesteiseemum, ‘most wretched:
Cas. III. v. 34; me infelicem vet seelestam, cist. IV. ii. 173 cf. Rud.
IV. iv. 1²35 mihi scelesto, Rud. 11. vi. 18 ; and advantage is
sometimes taken of the double meaning, as in As. 11. iv. 69, Age,

impudice, Sceleste. L. Non eudes me’hi sceleste subvenire. There is a
close analogy between the use of scelestus and the English adjective
wretched, which is ambiguous, since it may be applied to aman who

23· aut meam spectem alim inridere] Cf. 111. ii. 115 (113), Ergo
cisredere ne videm et gestire admodum (here absolutely); V. ii. 11
(iii. 11), Verbere, etiarn s'rere'eiest again absolutely. Examples of in·
re‘dere with the accusative may be found in Pseud. V. ii. 193 Poen. V.
ii. 713 Pers. V. ii. 16 ; Merc. II. i. 26. ,

32. illi Morem praecwue ss'e geres] Morem gere⁴re ols‘eui denotes
that a person suits or accommodates his or ber ways and wishes to
those of another, and hence signifies generally, ‘to comply with,' ‘to
obey! We have several examples in this play; 1. iii. 43, ⁶93 11. i.
513 111. i. 50 (51) ; ii. 36 (37): see also Pers. 1v. iv. 553 Capt. II.
iii. 44 ; Cure. 1. ii. 62; Men. V. ii. 37. Sometimes the phrase is ap-
plied to one who indulges his own inclinations‚ e. g. Amph. Prol. 131,
Pater nunciatus suo ansino morene gerit. From the combination
rnorem gerere are formed the adjective morigerus and the verb mori-
gere or morigeram· so below, II. i. 51, Morigerae tihi erirmw ambae,·
and in cist. I. iii. 27, Ea diem seeum obsit, sacta morigera est vtro,
i. e. ‘she did what her husband wished her to do-she died ;' and
I. i. 86, de ea regessit morem morigerae mehe, i. e. ‘in that matter
my mother yielded to me, who in other matters was obedient
to her3' and with marthus in Men. 1. iii. 19, Cape tihi hane (sc. pol·
lam).· werede une 'vebis mess morigere moechus. See also Cas. 11.
viii. 29 3 Cure. I. ii. 70; Amph. 111. iii. 16 ; Epid. V. i. 1. The verb,
is less common, but is found in both the active and deponent
form; Amph. III. iii. 16, Volo deindidem, demeum haesesuraria
Vxere nune mihi moriger0; and Capt. 11. i. 4, Nunc serw'tus si evenit,
ei ves morigerari mos henes est. The simple word neos is occasionally
