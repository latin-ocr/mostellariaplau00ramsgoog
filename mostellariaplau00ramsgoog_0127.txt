We have said that the first syllable is generally long in Plautus,
lor two or three examples are quoted in which it is said to be short.
But of these there is only one which will not bear examination.
This is Most 11. ii. 76,

Vivum mc arcessunt act Acheruntem mortui,

where all the best MSS. have the od, which however might very
readily have been interpolated by a transcribet, and be omitted

without injury to the construction, and it is singular that the poet
should have made the first syllable oi Acheruntem long in v. 67
and short in rr. 76. Three other examples are quoted from the

Poenulus-Ptol. 71 (Senar.)‚ 1. ii. 131 (Troch Tetr. Cat), IV. ii.9
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

ι. Ipse abitt ad Acheruntem sr'ne viatico.
a. Quo dte Orcus ah Acherunte mortuos amiserit.
3. Quodvis genus chi hominum uc'deac, quasi Acheruntem veneru.

But in the first example, an Anapaest in the second place of the
- &narian is perfectly admissible3* in the second, we may consider
the and foot to be aDactyl; in the third, qucsr', as elsewhere, may
be pronounced as a monosyllabis and totally elided And yet the
evidence afforded of the quantity ol Acheruns in these three lines
is considered by Weise sufficient to prove that the whole play is
spurious! The evidence therefore for Acheruns in Plautus rests on
the line of the Mostellaria alone, which, as we have pointed out
above, is suspicions and easily corrected

⁸¹ [ls an Anapaest admissible in the second place after a Dactyli Would

it not be simplet to omit the ad, as suggested in reference to the passage
quoted from Most. ll. ii. 7⁶? Spengel would read atie for atita-En]
