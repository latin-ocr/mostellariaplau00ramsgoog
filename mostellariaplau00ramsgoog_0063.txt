xlvi PROLEGOMENA.

employed the designation oi D paragogicum, a term as irrational as
that Of ἰῴσλκυστικόν in Greek.

lt appears chiefly' in datives and ablativos, but by no means
exclusively, and Charisius goes so lar as to assert that in ancient
times it was attached to all words ending with avowel. Thus, in
lwe have GNAIVOD; and in n. 63, 64, DE PRAIDAD; n. 181,
AIRE MOLTATICOD3 n, 190, MERITOD; 10 abounds in ex-
amples, such as SENTENTIAD ter, OQVOLTOD, POPLICOD‚
PREIVATOD, CONVENTIONID. These are all ablatives‚ but we
have in the same inscription, EAD, acc. pl, EXTRAD, FACILV·
MED, SED lor SE (the pronoun)‚ SVPRAD ter. Charisius, p. 87,
specially quotes led hom Plautus, 3ηά the forms med and ted occur
repeatedly in the MSS. of the plays. indeed, some scholars have
imagined that by a free introduction os d at the end os words ending
with a vowel, we might escape from the embarrassment felt by
metrical scholars on account os the constant recurrence of hiatus.

It is evident however, from our oldest inscriptions, that in the
early part ol the sixth century, although the use os the D para·
gogicum had not fallen entirely into dtsuse, it was not generally
employed, and hence any attempt to introduce it on an extensive
scale into the text ol Plautus would be unjustiliable.

Frhal M and lunai S.

That final m was but faintly pronounced is evident from the lact
that a final syllable ending in nt was elided besore a word beginning
with a vowel in all ages os Latin poetry. The same took place
frequently in words ending in us or ts, in the earlier ages oi Latin
poetry; the practice was still common in the age of Lucretius, but
afterwards lell into disuse. Hence it is not surprising that, in the
older class os inscriptions, final m is frequently omitted; and the
same holds good, but to a smaller extent, in final s also.

As instances ol the dropping os final m we have omwstm) [1],

[5], ANTIOCO(m) [6], ANNOvam) [8]. As we advance, the
practice becomes more 3ηά more rare, and finally disappears. From
the first, however, it was by no means uniformly observed: thus,
