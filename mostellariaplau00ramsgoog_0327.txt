“Hoc est, quare adhuc (etiam) cupiam vivere,” but rather, ‘this is
an additional motive for making me desire to live! In the same
scene, Planesium having used the word odram in reference to Patr·-

yours, call me an abominationi’ (With respect to the use of the
word odram in this passage, we may observe that although we (an

imo is to be rendered ‘¹ bald durch Ja wohl bald durch 0 nein.”
