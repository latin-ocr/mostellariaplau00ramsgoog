124 PanTI MOSTELLARIA.

Most. ΙΙΙ. i. ag (19), Mclw ne technae nicae perpetua minent, ‘I am
afraid that my schemes have been and will be upset one after another
without a pause ;' and so perpetuo perire significa the same as periri
in perpetuam nadnni, ‘to go to destruction headlong ;' Pers. 11. iv. 10,
Adel. 11. iv. 19, Eun. V. iii. 13. The phrase i'n perpetuam is some-
’ times equivalent to ‘always’ and may be used with reference to the
period of a whole life: Heaut. IV. v. 33; Cic. Cat. l. 1²3 Liv. VII.
37. The verb perpetuare occurs once in Plautus, Pseud. 1. iii. 72,
Nan eil i‘iisliii qnisquam amator iiiii qni perpetrent daia, ‘unless one
who makes presente uninterruptedly‚' and is found in Cicero also.
For other examples of perpetum and perpetio, see Amph. Prol. ⁶3
Poen. l. ii. 8²3 Pers. 111. i. s; Eun. V. iv. 1¹3 Adel. V. ix. 15 ;
And. 111. iii. 32; Adel. IV. i. 6 ; Hec. ill. iii. 46.

: t 64. Cor dolel] ie. ‘my heart aches,' from which is formed the
substantive cordolium, ‘the beart-ache,’ found twice in Plautus; Cist.‚
1. i. 67, Poen. l. ii. 863 and revived by Apuleius Met IX. 190. lt
has been adopted into Italian as cordagli‘a.

68. Di'scipnlinae aliis enain] i. e. ‘I was a pattem (or model) to
others! The original unsyncopated formos the word is here pre·
served in the Palatiue MSS. In this passage diicipiili'nae is equiva-
lent to exemplo, ‘l was a model from which others might leam
their duty,' but it assumes many shades of meaning, which may
however be easily connected with each other. Thus in As.1.iii.
49, eadem disciplina nii'rnin means‚' ‘we follow the same system ;'
in Cas. 111. v. 34, Atticam disciplinam, ‘the lavis and usages of
Athens ;’ and in υ. 38, Malarnni malam disciplinam, ‘the evil ex·
ample or customs of bad women ;' in Cist. 1. i. indisciplina is ‘the
ways and rules of a family ;' in Bac. I. ii. 37, iiia diciplina is exactly
represented by ‘your discipline‚’ via, that of a teacher towards a
pupil‚ and so ΙΙΙ. iii. 173 in Mil. 11. ii. 30, paret disciplinans, ‘let her
school herself ;' in hiereli, laec disciplina, ‘this fashion or eustom ;'
in Truc. I. i. 30, iia est diciplina, ‘thus are matters ordered ;’ in
l. ii. 29, ea indisciplina, ‘so was I trained to be!

- Parsimonia el darsiria discipulina alii’s erant] Di'sci'prili'nai may be
either the genitive after parsimonia and darili'ii, signifying ‘training,'
in which case the construction will be eram exemplo cliii, or the
dative, erari diicipiilinai aliis, i. e. ‘I was a lesson to others! .

1. iii. 9. Periere liaec oppida aedes] This is the reading of B, which
has lec, and was adopted by Camerarius; the rest of the MSS. have
liae. There can be no doubt however that liaec was used occa·
sionally by the older writers as the feminine nom. pl, and it is
