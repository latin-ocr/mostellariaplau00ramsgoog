adhuc mentm ita scriptis libris Iidem (sc. antiqui) voces quae

The passage from Velius Longus, pp. ²²³7» 2:38, must be read
earesully, but is too long to quote. From it we find, ι. That Nisus
wrote comest and amere (ie. apparently maednse and assumis-u, [οι
the words are corrupt) with one ι, giving two reasons ser eo doinffi
(ι) because a consonant cannot be doubled aster a long vovel;
(a) because the ‘antiqui’ did not double a consonant at all, but in-
stead os doubling placed a mark over the single consonant. a. Veliur
Longus conmdicts Nisus on two grounds ς (ι) the unquestionnble
usus os doubling a conronant aster a long vowel in such words as
[tras-re, tallone, abital-se, calcasse ; (a) that there is no real difference
between writing a doubled consonant and placing a mark over it to
point out that it was to be pronounced as double-1. He goes on
to renurk um the remu why we write narare with one R is that
it is derived sroni gnarus,

Agnin, he questions the propriety os spelling paullum with two Lo,
which was done by some because pullus has two Ls, and then adds,
¹‘ Hic (i.e. the word paullum) autem in longitudine syllabae anie-
oedoenn's huic literne (i. e. I) obstant. Est enim (Lei syllaba an-
tecedens) quam Graeci dicum θέφθυγγικ, iuxta quam omnino geminari
consonans non potest.''

That the earliest Latine did not double the semivovels is distinet-ly
asserted also by Quntilian, 1. 7, ξ ¹⁴³

“Semivocales non geminare din fuit usitatissimi moris ;¹' and the
same statement is made repeatedly by Festus, who however extends
tlte rnle w mutes aleo. Thus, s. v. anus, p. 6, ed. Mffll„ he says,
⁴¹ antiqui eam literam non geminabant,'' s. v. aulas, ‘¹ antiqui . , nullm
literam geminabnnt;¹' and again, “ antiqui non geminabant conso-
nantes;¹¹ and εν. solitaurilia, p. ²9³1 he ascribes the practice of
doubling consonante to Ennius, who adopted in this, as in other
things, the Greek fashion.

But ix· we retum to Quintilian, 1. 7. 5 ao, we find a passage
specially worthy os notice: “Quid? quod Ciceronis temporibus, pnul-
umque infla fere quoties S litera media vocalium longnrum vel
subiecta longis esset, geminabatur? ut causi-ae, cassus, mistiones, quo-
modo et ipsum (et) Virgilium qnogue scripsisse, manus eomnt docent.
