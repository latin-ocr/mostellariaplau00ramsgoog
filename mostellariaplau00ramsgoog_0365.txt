These words convey the idea ol ‘excessi But it must be borne '

in mind that excess may be of two kinds. The word may denote
that the object spoken ol transcends the limits of what is right,
proper, or convenient, in which case censure is conveyed, or it may
denote that the object spoken ol transcende the limits by which such
an object is usually bounded, and in this case censure or praise, or
neither, may be conveyed, according to circumstances. The former
meaning is usually expressed in English by the word ‘t00,' the latter
by ‘excessively‚’ ‘most' ‘very,' and is equivalent to a superlative.
Thus when we say that a person or thing is toa lang, or too short,
too rich, or too paor, we wish to indicate that the proper limit, in
each case, has been passed ; but when we say that a person or thing
is excessrbely lang, or excessibely short, excessrbcly rich, or excessrbrly
poor, we do not necessarily imply anything except that the usual or
ordinary limit has been passed. In Latin, minii, Maria, are used
in both senses, and we must, in each casesbe guided by the con·
text in determining which oi the two is applicable. The same takes
place in our own language with ‘too,' but to avery small extent, in
such colloquial phrases as that is spo good, too delrghfful, tao charmrbg,
too rriiiculous, too abrural The following examples will illustrate
what we have said.
