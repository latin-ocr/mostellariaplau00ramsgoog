248 PLAVTI lllOSTELLARIA.

Although al'umur must mean a Dinaeam in the passage quoted
above from the Truculentus, there are two others in which com·
mentators have believed that it clearly denotes a different sum, and
these we must examine. Ἰ

In Heaut. 111. iii. 38 Syrus fabricates a story to the following
effect: that an old woman of Corinth had horrowed 1000 drachmae
(drachmarum argenti malle) from Bacchis, and, having died without
paylng her debt, that her young daughter Antiphila had been left as
security in the hands of Bacchis, Ea relicta laur'c arraboni pra illa
argenta. Everything is distinct up to v. 43, but unfortunately the

- text of the two lines which follow (44, 45), as they appear in the

older editions, is admitted by all to be corrupt, and has been variously
emended by different editors. ln these lines the words malle numm
are found, and the sense is taken to be that Bacchis now wishes
Clinias to pay her 1000 numa} in consideration of which she will give
up Antiphila. lt is talren for granted that the mr'lle numum are
identical with the drachumarm argenti mille previously mentioned,
and hence it is inferred that auarus is here used as equivalent to
drachma. Now although it might be fairly urged that a passage in
which the text is avowedly cormpt and the meaning uncertain cannot
be received in evidence at all, yet, even admitting the interpretation
to be generally correct, it by no means follows that the conclusion
is inevitable. Syrus, to answer his own ends, had just characterised
Bacchis as apessuma meretrix, and what is more likely than that he
should represent such a person as not satisfied with having the mere
principal os the sum which she had lent repaid, butas secking a large
addition for interest, and as taking advantage of the passion of Cliniae
to demand double the original loan, that is, according to the view
given above, 1000 Numi or 2000 Brachmae. Terence uses numus
in one other passage only, Phor. 1. i. 3, 4, where the phrase intro-
duced, pauxr‘lulum numerum, decides nothing.

The second passage is in Most ΙΙ, i. ιο, Vel isti qui [hasn's] fatiam
nemorum causa subeunt rub salas, where Lipsius and others interpret
tres numito mean tres asses, and to refer to the daily pay of a Roman
soldier. lt is urged that this explanation is corroborated by the

well-known passage in Polybius (vl. 37), where he informs us that
the Roman legionary received two obols a day, which, if we adopt the
common practice of the Greek and Roman writers, and reckon the a
drachma and the datarr'ur as equivalent, would amount to 3} asses. But
there are various considerations which render this opinion untenable.
