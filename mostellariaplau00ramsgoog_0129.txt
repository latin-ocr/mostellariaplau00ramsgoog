cxii PROLEGOMENA.

' Ex unoquoque eorum excruciant crepr'trou palentan'un,

where the word must be scanned polentam, although poena has
the first short in Ovid and Persius But here we may observe that
polentarries is aword apparently coined by Plautus himself, and found
in this passage only, nor is it used by any other author until we
come down to Apuleius, and there is no reason why we should not
connect it with the kindred pollen. ln so far as the unsavoury J'oke
is concerned, the readers of Rabelais will at once perceive that it
will lose nothing of its force if we derive the word directly from
pollen, and not through the medium of munta.

. Suspicio, the substantive, with the second long, is frequently quoted
as an example of an anomalous quantity, because turpida the verb,
bas the second short„ But mpure, the noun, occurs frequently in
Plautus and Terence, and has the second syllable uniformly long;
it has the same syllable long in Martial and the later poets3 and, as
far as I know, no example of this word, with the second short, can
be quoted from any classical writer.

So also Rolnam (from rubeot) occurs twice, Cas. l. v. a, Stich. 1. iii.
77; coquinarum (from coqutnns), Aul. Ill. i. 3, Pseud ΙΙΙ. ii. 64 ; and
coquinare, v. 85; but these words occur in verse in Plautus only,
and therefore we cannot compare his practice with that of other
poets. Moreover, with regard to the first, the derivation of rannus
from rotro is by no means certain, and with regard to the second,
we might be led to believe, from a passage in Paul. Diae. (p. 61,
ed. Muti), that the form¹ used by Plautus was coqur'tare, and not
coquinare.

Protervur and its derivatives have the first syllable short in the
Augustan writers, as in the Horatian Choriambic,

Vrr‘t grata protervitas,
and the Ovidian pentameter,
Damnaret natr'sacta proterva pater,

while in Plautus, Bac. IV. iii 1 (Troch. Tetr. Acat),
Petulans protervo r'racundo anr'rno, r'rrdornito, riccogr'tato,
and Amph. ΙΙ. ii. 207 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Audacem esse, ct confidenter pro re et proremnqai,

protervo and proterve must have the first long. When however we
remember the uncertainty and inconsistency which prevails in the best
writers ss to the quantity of the first syllable of words compounded
with pro, we need feel no surprise with regard to protervus.
