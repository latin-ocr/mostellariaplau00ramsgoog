lxxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

suffr, o. 119,
Nunc si ille teuc salvos revenit reddam senem sr'bi.

The letter u coalesces occasionally with the vowel following in the
words duo quatuor,· both forms, aeos and deus, occur in the same pas·
sage in Most. ΙΙΙ. 11. 147 (145) and 149 (147) (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Viden pictum ubi ludificatur corm‘x una volturios awos)
Cornix astat, ea uolturios du‘or ar'ce’ssem vellicat ,·
so Trin. 111. iii. 45 (senar),
Duas eas nos consignemus quasi sint a patrm
Truc. 11. ii. 5² (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Querquam 101110 mortale& posthae duarum rerum ereduit,·

Poen. IV. 11. 75 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

De praedone Siculo. M. Quanti? S. Duodeviginti menes.
M. effi illas duodeuege'ntr'? S. Et nutricem earum ternam,

where we must pronounce duas as amonosyllable: duodevigenti may
in each line be regarded either as a sexsyllabic or quinquesyllabic
word: in the one case the first three syllables will form an Anapaest‚
in the athera Spondeo ; Most. 111. i. 121 (117) (senaa),

Quatu‘o‘r quadragenta illi debentur me'nae.
, In Men. Ι. iii. 11, ²3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Quatuor menis ego emr’ istanc anno uxori meae
Quatuor menae perurunt plane, ut ratio redditur,

it will be observed that quatuor is a trisyllable with the first
syllable long.
Fuit is amonosyllable Truc. 11. i. 7 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),

Dum su‘rt, dedit: nunc 1111111 habet: quod lambat, nos habemus.

We have thus seen that the principle ο1 synizesis, ol which we find
occasional examples in the writings ο1 the Augustan poets, was em-
ployed to a 111 greater extent, and in a much bolder manner, by the
early dramatista But Ritschl, while in his eagerness to establish the

, purity and correctness of the metres ο1 Plautus he would deprive

1111101 those licences in which the most lastidious versifiers have

indulged, is in some particulare willing to grant him an amount ol
license from which the most careless would have shrunk. ln sup·
port ο1 the theory that the dramatists were in many cases indifferent
to the Rule os Position, he adduces a number ο1 examples to prove
11111 such words as peristromata, expapillato, somnus, suptltex, trapdee'ta,
