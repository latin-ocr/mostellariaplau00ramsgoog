EXCVRSVS XIV.-TALEN'I'VM, MINA, dxc. 241

Adel. IV. ii. 11, v. 63, Andr. IV. iii. 6, V. iv. 52, Eun. IV. iv. 18,
Heaut. Il. iii. 26, 98, Phor. II. ii. 5, 111. iii. ao: coaxing, Truc. V.

Poen. Ι. ii. raa, V. iv. aa. It will be seen lrom the above examples
that obsecro, like amabo, is not unirequently followed by the accu-
sative of the person appealed to, but more frequently does not take
a case, and is in many instances amere exclamation. ln Heaut.
IV. i. 31 it is construed with a double accusative, Mi Chreme, peccaut,
fateor, vtitcor, nunc hoc te opsecro,· and in Pers. 1. i. 49 the entreaty is
strengthened by the addition os resecto-Opsecro te, resecro, operam da
hanc milri fidelem.

Perhaps it is scarcely worth remarhing that while amabo recurs
again and again in Plautus, obsecro is found in comparatively few
passages, while Terence evinces a decided preference for obsecro over
amabo,· quaeso is more common, in proportion, in Plautus than in
Terence; sodes is used upwards of a dozen times in the six plays os
Terence, and not more than five or six times in the twenty plays
ol Plautus. Salui does not occur in Terence; it is quoted by Festus
(pp. 301, 343, ed. llltlll.) from Plautus, Cato, and Ennius.

XIV.-TERMS EMPLOYED WITH REFERENCE TO
MONEY.

TALENTVM, MINA, DRACHMA, OBOL VS, PHILIPPVS
s. N VM VS PHILIPPE VS, N VM VS s. N VM VS
ARGENTI.

l. Talentum, Melta, Drachnm, Obolus. As might be expected,
considering the source from which the worlrs ol Plautus and Terence
are derived, the sums ol money mentioned in their plays are, sor
the most part, calculated according to the Greek system ol Talents,
Minae, and Drachmae.

We may remind the young scholar that these terms all denoted

certain weights, and that although the absolute value of each differed
in different states, their mutual relation was invariable. Mz'mz may
be represented in all cases hy the English word Pound, but as the
Avoirdupois Pound differs from the Troyes Pound, and both lrorn
the Italian Pound, so the Mina ol Athens was different in absolute

weight from the lllina ol AEgina, and both differed lrom the lllina
