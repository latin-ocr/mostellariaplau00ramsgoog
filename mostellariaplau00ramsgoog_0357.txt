having forgotten the name of Charmides, from whom he pretended
to be the bearet of a letter, Channides who is playing with him, says
ironically-C. Ve'o'e, homo, ut hommem nocvert's. S. Tamquam me, ‘see
you now then, my good sellow, how sar-to what extent-you are
acquainted with this person,’ to which the Sycophanta rephes‚ ‘1
know him as well as 1 know myself.'

This is probably the soree of ut in Bac. 11. ii. 30, Imo ut eum,
eredis, misera aremus desederat: all the MSS. have cum, for which
recent editors, following Acidalius, substitueram, but if we punctuate
as above the change is unnecessary. We have already quoted this
line under r'rao, p. 199 sub fin.

In Most. Ill. ii. 14⁶ (144) ut is equivalent to quanto,· T. Vt
quecquid mages comtemplor, tanto magis placet.

4. Vt, ‘how,' in the sense ‘of what kind' (quales), as in the
English phrase, ‘how is he as to ternperl’ thus in Stich. 1. ii. 55,
where Antipho and Pinacium are discussing mulierum mores, the
latter says—P. Scio ut oportet esse si seht ita ut ego aequom carseo.
A„ Volo seire ergo, ut aequom censes. P. Vt per urbem quom ambulent,
Ommlus os optarent ne ques mere'to maled'cat sele, where the first and
second ut are equivalent to quoles,· so in Cure. 1. i. 59, Imo ut t'llom
censes? it is clear from the context that these words are equivalent
to qualem illam censes esse,· so Amph. Prol. 104, Nam ego vos novasse
credo ehm ut sit poter meus, &eam liber harum rerum multarum siet,
‘I take it for granted that you know what kind of person my father
is, how he conducts himself' &c

This force of ut may, not unfrequently, be represented by the
English ‘asz' Amph. III. iii. 4, Atque e'ta servom par vedetur sruge'
sese restituere, Proinde luri ut seut, ipse item st't, where Proinde ut,
‘just as,' is equivalent to quales,· so Capt. 11. i. 32, Ero, ut me uoles
esse, ‘I shall be as you wish me to be,’ i. e. ‘such as' tales qualem,-
and again, o. 39, Nunc ut te mihi uolo esse, esse autumo,· Truc. 11. vii.
16, meretricem ego item esse reor mare ut est, ‘such as is the sea,'
talem quale.

ln Men.11.iii. 78, Mus. Quid ergo? Marc. opus est. Mas. Quid
opus est? Marc. Sce'o, ut me doces. Mna Tanto nequior cs: the text
is probably corrupt.

5. Vt, ‘h0w,' has frequently an explanatory force in dependent -
clauses; thus in English, ‘I will tell you how it happened,' ‘let us
consult how we may best assist him,' and the like. ln all such cases
ut, in Latin, must be followedby the subjunctive: Poen. 1. i. ⁶6,
Abeamus metro ut Collubeicum m'lle'cum Hanc perdoceamus ut serat
