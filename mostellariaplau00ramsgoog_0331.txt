198 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

1. Correction of a positive blunder: Cist. ll. i 37, Α. Itaque me
Iuno regma el Iom's supremi filia, Itaque me Saturnus patruus erus.
M. Ecastor, paler. Α. Itaque me Ops ‹pulenm illius auro. M. Imo,
neuter quedem, ‘no, no, Ops was his mother, not his grandmothert’
here the correction of the first mistake is introduced by Ecastor.

Simple correction: Cist. 11. iii. aa, P. Aa, amabo, nuretrr'x r'llo est,
quae illam sustulere L. Imo nuretrrlusur't. The last words must not
be translated ‘yes, she was,’ but the emphasis depends upon the
change of tense from the present est to the past fuel. Phanostrata
asks, ‘what‚ tell me,l beg. is that woman who brought him up au
hetaeral' to which Lampadius replies‚ ‘no‚ she is not, but she was:
she is an old woman now! ’

The use of rma in the following passage must be ranked under this
head; Eun.111.i. 17, Thraso is boasting of the confidence reposed
in him by the Rex whom he served, and goes on, T. Tum me con-
m'uom solum abducebat sr'br'. G. Hui! Regem elegantem narras. Τ. Imo
sic domo est Perpaucorum hommum. G. Imo nullorum arbitror, Si
tecum vehet: here, in each case, rma introduces acorrection: G. ‘You
describe a king fastidious in the choice of his associates,' to which
Thraso, all unconscious of the contemptuous irony of Gnatho, replica,
T. ‘Nay (you must not suppose that he has many associates)‚ such
as he is towards me (although treating me with the highest duunc-
tion), he is one who bestows his friendship on very few men,' on
which Gnatho remarks aside, ‘nay, (say rather) on none at all-if he
lives with you,’ the emphasis being on nullorum horterum, ‘on none
who deserve the name of men, if you are a sample of his favourites.'

2. Again, emo is often used to correct and improve some expres·
sion, the correction frequently consisting in the substitution of a
strong svord for a weak one3 Eun. lV. vii. 41, T. Qurii nunc agriem?
G. Qum redeamus: mm haeclr'be' aderit supplicans Vllro. T. Credin?
G. Imo cerfe, noui r'rrgemum multarum: here t'mo certe does not mean
‘yes assuredly,’ but into is introduced with reference to the word
creden, which implies a certain degree of doubt. The true translation
is, therefore, T. ‘Do you believe thati' G. ‘(Believe it l) no, no,
(‘believe' is too weak a word,) l am sure of it ;' Phor. 1. ii. 95,
D. Non mullum hobel Quod delfirrlasse. G. Imo mhr‘l, ursi spem merom,
which we must render, D. ‘Perhaps he has not much to give! G. (ΝΟ,-
(¹ mulmm' is not the word.) he has nothing ;' Eun. ll. iii. 36, C. Is,
dum sequor hone, fil mr'lu’obvram. P. Incommode, hercle. C. Imo errem·
uero refellerim, Nam incommoda alr'o sun! dicenda, Parmeno. Imo refers
to incommode. ιΝο, ‘anconemode’ is not the word, you should have
