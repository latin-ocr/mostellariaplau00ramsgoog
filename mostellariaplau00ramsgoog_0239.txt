58. Nisi te nala re magna nacturi cupis] The verb macto deserves
particular notice. It seems to be derived from the same root as
inagis and magnus, and to be a frequentative form of an obsolete
verb, mago, of which the participle nactus remained in use. 1. The
original signification of macto was ‘to magnify,' ‘to glorify,' in the
sense of paying homage to a deity by offerings or sacrifices, and
thence was applied to men when 'exalted by honour. In this sense
it is constructed with the accusative of the object to which homage is
pald, and the ablative ol the object employed to testify homage.
Thus, Cic. in Vat Vnt 14, Volo ut mibi respondeas . . . quae te tanta
prauitas meritis tenuerit, qui tantuss'eror, ut, quum inaudita ac nefaria
sacra susceperis, quien inferorum animas elicere, quum puerorum extz‘s
Deos Manes mactare soleas, &c.; and De Rep. Ι. 43, Eos autem, qui
in magiitratu priuatorum seniles esse velent, eosque probatos, qui effcibnt
nequid enter probatum et nagittratun differatserunt laudibus et mactant
bonoribus. So also Enn. Ann. IX. frag. II. ed. Vahlen, Lioeies ende
redit magno neactatus triumpho. 2. Hence macto significa simply, ‘to
offer in sacrifice,' and is constructed with the accusative of the thing
offered, to which the dative of the object to which the sacrifice is
offered is sometimes added. Examples are very common, e. g.
Lucret 111.52, Et nigras mactant pecudes et Manibus debis Iiy'erios
mittunt,· Varro ap. Non. p. 341, Quod Kalendis Iuniis et publice et
probation sanatam pultem Diis mactat,· again, passively, Hor. C. 1. xix. 16,
Mactata veniit lenebr hortia; and in Liv. X. 28, Decius exclaims, Iam
ego nucum hosdem legtbnes mactandas Telluri ac Diis Manibus dabo.
3. We now come to that sense which is exemplified in our text, the
sense in which it is used almost invariably by Plautus,*-to magnify
with a bad or ironical force, ‘to load a person with misfortune,' and

' is then constructed with the accusative of the person and the ablative

of the word denoting misfortune. Thus we have in Aul. 111. v. (ιι,
· Dotatae mactant et malo et damno ve'ros,· and in a fragment of the
Amph, At ego certe cruce et cruciatu mactabo: exi, 0,sorar, mastigia.
The expression is very frequently couched in the form of an impre-
cation, e. g. Trin. IV. ii. 151, Ego ob hanc operam argentum accepi:
te macto ensuertunioe and Bae. IV. viii. 45, Et ego te et ille mactamus
znfiirtunio,· and so Cure. IV. iii 5, Bac. 11. iii. 130, Poen. III. i. 14.
This use ol the word is by no means peculiar to Plautus, for we read ν
in Ennius (frag. Teleph. V. ed. Vahlen), qui ellum dii deaeque magno

* We can scarcely consider Rud. l. ii. 8 an exception, Si sapiam, boc,

quod me nractat, concinnem lutum, where mactat meanS, is ‘tormenting me,’
is ‘playing the deuce with me! ’
