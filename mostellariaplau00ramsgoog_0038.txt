But when Cornutus, in the passage quoted above, enjoins us to
write causa, md adds, “nee quemquam movent antiqua scripturn
nam et actu-reare per duo SS m'ipserunss' and when Mu, vict.
assem tha« the antiqui wrote such words as ausus, caum snum,
odiam, with a double S, aursus, &eq we inser fron-i the passage in
Quintilian, quoted above, that anh'qua sm'peura and antiqui indicate
not the predecessore os Ennius, but the obtemperas-ies of Cioero and
Virgil.

The passage from Mar. Vict. on the same topic is such a cur-inus
mss of confusion and contradiction, that we have quoted it nt length
above, ω avoid the suspicion of misrepresenting his meaning< From
this it vill be seen that he enunciata three propositivus: (r) that the
antiqui* did not double consonarum at 2113 (a) that when it was neces-
sary (φονῇσι) to double a consonant, they placed a mark called
a sicilicus over the consonant to be doubled; (³) that the anh'qui
did double the consonanti in words qim passum sano eduntur, such
aa mas, cauea, etc. Nisus says the same thing with regard to the
Sisdicus, but is very properly censured by Velius Longus, who remarks
that there is in rulity no differenoe between doubling a consonant
and placing Α mark over a single consonant, to point out that it was
ιο be promunced ns double. But the euricus circumstance con-
necoed with these statement! is, that among all the inscriptions
preserved, no trave os my mnsk corresponding to what is called the
Sionem mn be discovered⁴

Moreover, the uident gumar-imi frequently state their own tancies
and conjectures and them-ies as if they were acknowledged [mets.
Thus Cornutus, in the passage already quoted, partizlly lezds us to
inser that the une of the double S in sncl- words as fuisse, divam-se,
me, and emam. vu an amiqua temptum u much as occursare,
'heren in point oi fact these words were unisormly written with a
double S, exoept in the very earliest times With equal recklessness
Velius Longus, ιε.. amens that the verb narro ought to be spelled
with a single R. beaw it is derived from gnarus!
