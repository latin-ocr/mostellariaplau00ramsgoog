lxxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

in such words as auus, oae's, oues, moes, naeuos, tec, the two syllables
may be contracted into one: thus Bac. IV. vi. 27 (Sanan),

Bene eta—tas agitatur, pulcre laec confertur ratlac
Aul. IV. vii. 3 (Sanan),
Fac montonem cunt aa—on'culo, mater mca‚·
Asin. 1. iii. 65 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

osnes adsuescunt. Mae estsacere sumptum qul quaerit lucram,

where aues is a monosyllable and necesse est a dissyllable; ll. ii. ¹05
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Mox quom Saurean luctabor a'n'a'cto nc succenseas,

where caveto is pronounced cauto. Α

There is a curious passage in the truculentus, 111. ii. 15, where
Stratilax enunciates cauallator as caullator, and Astaphium ridiculas
him lor his pronunciation,

S. Heus tu, eam postquam in arhen crebro commeo,

Dicox sunt factus: tam sum cavellator (i. e. caullator) probus.

A. Quid iot cst, ornabo? Istooccc nlla'cularta

Cauo'llotr'oous vt's sortasse dicere.

S. Ita, ut pauxillum dcfflrant a caoitlute‘s (i. e. caululrl or
cadolus, ‘cabbages').

The well-known story in Cic. Div. ΙΙ. 40 serves to illustrate the
popular pronunciation ol cave. There was a town in Caria called
Caunus, famous lor its ligs, which were imparted into Italy and
hawked about, the cry used by the vendors being Cauneas! When
Crassus was embarking his troops at Brundusium, previous to his
fatal campaign against the Parthians, he encountered one ol these
itinerant dealers, and Cicero says it might be urged by the super·
stitious that if he had been warned by the omen he might have
escaped destruction ; Cauneas and Coae nc eas being, it would appear,
identical in pronunciation.

So with the word tuventus,· Amph. 1. i. a (lamb. Tetr. Aean),

Iu'tffntuta's mores qui sclam, qui hoc noctes solus ambulent,

where we must pronounce Iwcntutz's or Iuntutei, not, as some would
have, Iuventati& in Cure. 1. i. 38 (Sanan),

tumtun et pucros liberc's,· anta quid lubet,

quentate is a trisyllable‚ anta a monosyllable3 in Most. 1. i. ²9
(Sanan),
