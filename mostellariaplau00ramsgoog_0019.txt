Difficulties and jealousies regarding the use of this MS. seem to

have arisen between the Cardinal and Poggio, whose letters are filled
with complaints, and we know not precisely at what period it was
placed at his disposal. Acopy, however, made by some one, was
sent to the Duke of Milan in 1431, and the MS. itself was sent to
Florence at the request of Lorenzo de Medici, and there a copy of
the last twelve plays was made by Niccolo Niccoli with his own hand,
and this very copy is known to have existed at a comparatively
recent period in the Library of St. Mark at Florence, but it is not
certain where it is now to be found. .
, For a long period the MS. brought to Italy by Nicolas of Treves
was the only source from which the twelve plays were derived.
Merula, in his preface to the Editio Princeps (¹47²)› speaks of the
last twelve Comedies as having been discovered forty years before
the time when he was writing, and adds that there was but one MS.
from which, as from an archetype, all the copies in circulation had
been derived; and again, Ugoletus, in 1515, employs the same
language.

It appears, from what hasbeen said above, that the MS. of Nicolas
of Treves was copied at least twice within two years from its arrival
at Rome, and these copies, and probably the original MS. als0, would
be transcribed and retranscn'bed until the twelve new plays became
generally known to the literary men of Italy and Germany. But we
must not suppose that the whole or even the greater number of these
copies cprresponded with each other, and were faithful representatives
of the MS. from which they were derived. That original, as de·
scribed by Poggio, is written in a character hard to be decyphered,
the words are not properly divided, and it abounds in corruptions
of every kind Moreover the archaic forms, strange words, and
colloquial phrases which abound in Plautus even when represented
correctly in the MS, would in many cases be unintelligible to the
scholars of that day, and would by them be regarded as corruptions.
Hence all who applied themselves to these pursuits would endeavour
to reduce their author into an intelligible form by correcting as they
went, a practice almost universal at that period, and Poggio, in one
of the passages quoted above, speaks of this process as essential, and
evidently intended, when he gained possession of the MS, not to
make a faithful transcript, but to present a text elaborated by his own
