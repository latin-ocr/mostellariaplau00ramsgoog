xii PROLEGOMENA.

There is one correction, probably of alate date, in the margin

ol 111. ii. 5,

alqnam Non milu'sorte ouum ilico furi,
i. e. aliqui legunt nam. This appears to be the only example ol a
correction in this hand in this play, and it is impossible to assign
a date to it either positive or relative: the int is rather pale.

Finally, there are here and there, especially towards the end ol
the play, some corrections and remarks written in black ink in a
hand strongly resembling that of Camerarius, and which have been
ascribed to him. Thus, in Ι. iii. 9 3, which appears in B,

Mulier quest suarnq glutem spernit speculo elusa erl,

where the a in elusa is written over an erasure, we lind in the margin
in the hand spoken ol, elusus est. These notes, by whomsoever
written, are evidently modern, and may be salely neglected by any
collator, however scrupulous. They are most numerous in Ill. ii,
and sometimes are a sort ol explanatory commentary, as in a. 26,

Hoc habel repperi qui senem manem,

where we find, interlined above repperi, astutiam and so in v. 51,
above qui is written quemodo as an explanation.

The following is a list of the interpolatione in red ink by Came-
rarius in the Mostellaria:

III. i. 6, 7, stands in B,
Danista adest qui dedit,

Qui amieo dai empta quq'
Camer. completes the lines with argenta senaria and opus in triplus
sual. Δ

v. 21 stands in B,
Τιι, (so written above)

Ditem queso . deiri rirquarn ordine omnib.
Camer. has alque interlined above the words inquam ordire*
v. 23 stands in B,
Negat? quom cogita.
Camer. correcta, Ta. Negat requam. Ta. perii oppilio, and an o in
red inlr over the a in cogita.
v. 24 stands in B [with some scratches below and above the

syllables si coa-En}
driam si consessus sil

Camer. has Non confitetur? and then some scratches [the first being
apparently an erasure ol the name There. or Tra—En}

* [οτ rather between the two-Em]
