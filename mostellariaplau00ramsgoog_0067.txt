Ill—THE METRES AND PROSODY OF PLAUTUS.

Comic Metus*

There is no topic connected with classical literature which,
generally speaking, proves so repulsive to a young scholar as an
inquiry into the metres ol Plautus and Terence. This arises not
so much irom the difficulties which the subject presents, although
these are unquestionably numerous and perplexing, as from the
manner in which the subject hasbeen handled. He will lind him·
sell called upon to peruse a series ol disquisitions by different
authors who accord with each other neither in principles nor details,

- but, on the contrary, exhibit ior the most part fierce antagonism,

agreeing in this only, that each propounds his ideas with dogmatic
confidence, and assumes a contemptuous and insolent tone towards
those whose views differ from his own.

The extreme positions in the controversy are held by two
parties. The· followers of the one, whenever they encounter a
difficulty, are satisfied with calling it a ‘licence’-a term which,
ii used freely and without discrimination, suffices to abrogate all
metrical lawa.

Those who adhere to the other have persuaded themselves that
the verses of Plautus and Terence were constructed with thesaure
delicate care, precision, and strictness which characterise those os
the best Greek models, and that wherever we meet with any corn·
bination inconsistent with this doctrine we must at once pronounce
the passage corrupt, and proceed to correct it. Il we adopt this
view to its full extent, we shall be called upon to re-write at least
one-fourth os the plays now extant.

The ample space between these two poles hasbeen occupied by
those who entertain more moderate opinions, and who by their
researches have done much to throw light upon what is obscure.
But almost every one os these has some favourite hypothesis ap·
plicable to a particular class os cases3 these hypotheses are for the ,
most part founded on a very limited and imperfect induction, and
