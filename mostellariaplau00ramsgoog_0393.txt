260 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

The occupatiori itseii was called Carnuficc'na, cist. Il i. ¹3 and
those who practised it were said carnufieinam facere, Capt 1. ii 29,
-equivalent to which is facere quaestum carcerarium, v. 26. The
employrnent was by no means honourable nor popular, and benoe
no term oi vituperationis more common than carnusesc.¹

The word Lorarii is found in the Dramatis Personae and stage
directions ol some plays, but does not occur in the textos any
classical author. Aulus Gellius (Nn X. 3) tells us that, aller the
departure oi Hannibal from Italy, the Romans refused to acknow·
ledge the' Bruttii assentatio enrol them as soldiers, but employed
them to discharge servile duties ior provincial govemors-“Itaque
hi sequebantur magistratus, tamquam in scenicis sabulis qui dioe-
bantur lorarii, et quos erant iussi vinciebant et verberabant.”

Sometimes fantastic terms are used: thus anc. lv, iii. 8, Nisi si
ad tr'ntirmaculos aas voltis educi ve'ros, where the unaunaculi or'ri are
the floggers who make the scourge sing or whistle about the ears ol
the sufferers: in like manner Pseud. 1. iii. 98, Lauros ende arcessam
duos cum antennabulis. Eadem dua greges vs'rgarum inde ulmearum ad·
egero,· with which compare Rud. III. v. 25, D. Ehem! optume edepol,
eccum clavator aduenit. L. Illud quc'dem edepol transmeatum cst aurelia,-
while in Pers. II. iii. ra we have another expression ior the sound
oi the lash upon the flesh, Diu quod lene erit die una apsolvam, tax tax
tergo macerit.

We may conclude by quoting some lines lrom As. 111. ii. r, which
give a sort oi summary oi the tortures inflicted upon slaves ; Perfidiae
laudes gratiasque hammus merito magnas, &om nostres sucophantci's,
doles, astutiisque, Scapularum confidentia, virtute ulmorum freti, Qui
advorsum stimulos, laminas, crucesque, compedesque Neruas, catenas,
carceres, nunccllas, pedicas, botas, Indoctorcsque acerrimos, gnarosque
nostri tergi, Qui saepe ante in nostras scapulas cicatrices indiderunt,·
and with these we may compare Men. V. vi. 8, Recordctur id, qui
nihili sunt, quid iis preti Detur ab suis heres, ignaua, mprobis Viris:
verbera, compedes, molae, magna Lassituda, fames, frigus durum, Haec
pretia sunt ignauiae. Asew oi the words given above may require
explanation, in addition to what has been said already.

Lamrnae were thiu plates of metal raised to ared heat and applied
to the flesh: they are spoken ol by Lucretius, ΙΙΙ. 1029, Verbera, car-
nufices, robur, pix, lamina, taedae,· by Cicero, In Verr. Act. ΙΙ. v. ⁶ 3, “
Quidquum ignes ardentesque laminae ceterique cruciatus admovebantur?
and by Horace, Epp· 1. xv, 36, Scilicet ut ventres lamera candente ne-
potum Diceret urcndes corrector Bestius.
