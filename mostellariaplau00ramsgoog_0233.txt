100 PLAVT 1 MOSTELLARIA.

decumam portem Herculi* polluceaoc. We find also the participle in
Rud. 11. iv. 11, Non ego sum pollucta pugo. Potire’ ut me upsttneos
monum) which must mean, ‘Hands off l 1 am no tit bit for the
bumpkins of the parish‚' i. e. ‘I am meat for your masters' The
application ol this word in Cure. 1. iii. 37, Tun' meam Venerem vitupe-
ror? Quod quidem melei polluctus virgei seruos sermonem serotl which
must signify ‘a slave who hasbeen entertained with a liberal allow·
ance of stripesz’ for the verb pollucere signifying ‘to offer in sacrifice,’
and the custom being to present the most choice objecta of each
kind to the gods, the derivatives of pollucere frequently convey the
notion of sumptuousness, magnificence‚ unsparing liberality; thus
we find in Macrob. -S. 11. 13, polluce'be'lei ceno in the sense of a
sumptuous banquet‚ and in the passage before us opsonote pollucibiliter
mean, ‘make your maritet without stinting yourself.' So also we
have seen above, in the passage quoted from Cassius Hemina,
polluctum used in reference to abanquet prepared in honour of the
gods without regard to price; and Macrob. S. 11. re mentions
specially a polluctum Herculis; in the Rud. V. iii. 63 we read,
Spectatores, uos quoque od cercone accenderemus nel sein, neque sit
quiequam pollucti domi, i. e. ‘anything dainty;’ and finally, in Stich.
V. iv. 6, lethe qucilem Hodie polluctura, praeler nos, ciem dubitur metiri,
i. e. ‘good cheer.’ The modification in meaning which pollucere and
its derivatives assumed in the later writers may be scen by referring
to the Lericons. The etymology is uncertain, but'it has been
· conjectured with some plausibility that it is connected with porrecto,
which also is a sacrificial word. See Priscian IX. p. 874, and
quotation from the Colax of Naevius. See also Bentley’s Terence,
ed. Volbehr, p. xxvi.
