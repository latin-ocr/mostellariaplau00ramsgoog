ingenuity. This system wu enmunged by those who lectured
publicly on Plautus, and who were compeued to submit him to their
auditore in ι shnpe which wuld be understood. Hence each plzy
became encnmbered with a mm ol* conjectum-l emendations and
urbitnry changes, mmy oi* diem ingenious, some probably true, but

the gruter number altogether preposterous. The object in view ·

was, however, accompiished, md editions os the different piacet
were circulated, mdable indeed, but in which the genuine text was,
in innumerable passages, recklenly sacrificed whether this work
wns performed by many hands, ns is most proboble. or by one
individua, possibly Poggio himself, ns Ritschl believes, we are
unable to determine, but the corrected piecee were certainly collected,
flmnged, and combined before the end os the fifteenth century, and
thus arose ι family or interpolated MSS„ which became largely
multiplied, of which specimens are to be l'ormd ‘tn most os the
great libmries os Europe, and which, although differ-ing in details,
nll bear a general md even close resemblance to each other.

The Editio Princeps os the whole twenty plays was printed. n
noticed above, nt Venice in 1472, the editor being Georgius Merula-
ln his prefaee he repeatedly complains os the numerous corruptions
which had been introduced hy the perversity ol* ignorant or hals—
learned gratiarnm-inus, und of the difficulty os procuring a sair-liful
u’nnscfipt of the original MS. from which the last twelve plays hwd
been derived g and it would appear that in so sar u the Bacchides,
the Mosellam, the Menaechmi, the Illr‘les, and the Mercator were
conoerned, he had been obliged ro content himself with interpolnted
copies, und that, in consequence, these phys were exhibited under
a worse aspect thm the remainder.

For eighty years nster the appearance os the Editio Prinoepe,
which was reprinted ot Treviso in 1482, the text of Plautus under-
went little or no improvement< Editions were published by Scutarins
os Vercelli (1490), by Snracenus (Venice, 1499), by 10. Baptista
Pius (Milan. 1500), by Ph. Beroaldus (Bolognz, 1500), by Pylndes
(Bremia, 1506, reprinted nt Venice, 1511)1 by Ugoletus (Par-mn,
¹5¹0), and the two editions oi* Simon Chupenm-ins (Lyons pro-
bably, 1513, md Paris), and many odrers of inferior note. Nume-
rous changes were introduced by the whole of these, especially by
Pylades, who may be said to have remodelled the existing text, but
although some or 211 os thern may have had necess to a correct copy
