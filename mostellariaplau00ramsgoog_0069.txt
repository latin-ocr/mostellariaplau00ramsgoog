dialogue is carried on either in the Iambic Trimeter Acat or in
Trochaic Tetrameter Cat.; that ,the Iambic Tetrameter Cat, the
measure ol which Aristophanes was so lond, is occasionally
employed, and also, although more sparingly, Trochaic and Iambic
Tetrameters Acatalectic. Moreover, Bacchiae and Cretic Tetra·
meters are so frequently introduced that they can be easily recog·
nised, and also, although with less. certainty, the shorter species
and varieties of verses belonging to tlte whole ol the sour classes
specified.

But, in so far as the Cantr'ca are concemed, me case is altogether
different. Some ol these present little orno difficulty, in others all
is doubt, uncertainty, and confusion. Metrical scholars have accord·
ingly here given free rein to their imaginations, and, as might have
been anticipated, have arrived at the most discordant results. We
have excellent examples of both kinds ol Cantica in the Mostellaria
The Canticum with which me Second Act commences can be
arranged in a satisfactory manner with little difficulty, and without
any important changes in the text, and we shall take an opportunity
below oi reviewing it in detail. But the Canticum with which the
Fourth Act commences presents a different aspect. In B, the most
trustwortiry ol our MSS, the monologue is divided into twenty-five
lines, of which four in succession (6, 7, 8, 9) are mutilated, ex·
hibiting lacunae to the extentos about two words in each, and a. 15
is evidently very corrupt. Hermann (Lib. 11. c. xxiii.) distributes
the words into twenty-six lines, leaves many blanks, and introduces
several conjectura} changes. Ritschl distributes the words into
twenty-seven lines, introducing a set ol changes different from those
oi Hermann, and agreeing with him as to the structure oi seven or
eight lines only. Weise distributes me words into thirty-seven lines,
differing totally from those oi Hermann and Ritschl. The remainder
of the scene, in which a second speaker is introduced, is distributed
in B into seventeen lines, and by Hermann into the same number,
but his arrangement is totally different. Some critics had sup-
posed that they were irregular Cretica, but Hermann has convinced
himself that they may be divided into Iambic Tetrameters Cat, but
admits that numerous alterations are necessary* Ritschl adopts
this theory and most os Hermann's emendations in so sar as me
first eleven lines are concerned, but the remainder he supposes to
consist ol a compound measure, made up of an Iambic Dimeter

aber sreilich mancher Verinderung bediirfen.”
