4. V. ii. 7 (Senon),
Tu gravidum item fieriu, quom in exercitum,
where quom is not elided, and then the fourth loot is a Dactyl.
reram seems to occur m nin. rv. ri. ιω (Troch. retr. cn),
Vel trecentas-Haben tu id aurum quod accepistis Charmide?

'l’his seems to be the reading oi the MSS, and ii retained would in-
volve the shortening ol occeperim but a case oi this sort fully justifies
a simple transposition; read therefore with Hermann—

Vel trecenos-Haben tu aurum id quod occcprih'a Charmade?

which is more natural and obvious than the emendation oi R. ·

W. retains the Vulgare without remark.

Gttbsrnabunt is quoted lrom Mil. IV. ii. 99. Even supposing the
line to lorm one ol an Anapaestic system, the measure is avowedly
loose aud irregular. W. says, in his Index, ‘gubernabunt correptim!

drgenh‘ is quoted irom Capt Cat 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Nec pueri supposuit neque argenti circumducito,

which 1 would scau by pronouncing neque as a monosyllable, and
then eliding it altogethe13 again, in Curc. V. ii. 15 (Troch. Tetr.
Cat),

(luffa-rgentum, quas tu malti tricas narras? quam tu originem?

quod, like quid, must be suppressed.* See other examples in the
Index ol W. under quod cst.
dstuteh, apparently in Capt. 11. i. 53,

Memorzter meminisse, eires! spes nobis in hac astutrh.

So the Vulgate. There is a difficulty in the scansion, which Linde·
mann removes by reading hac in astutia. Bothe has nobie hut‘c
astutrhe. [ll lor eires! we substitute est, there would be no difficulty.

Fenlgtra seems to occur in the following passages: Rud. Ι. i. 6
(Senen,

Illustriorer fecit fenestrasque odida,
Cas. 1. 44 (Senam),
Quidsacr'esd-Concladbre in fenestram firmite&

aa} ἓξὲξ-Ποῖ this line be scanned more simply by transposing ru,

Quod tu argentum, quas mihi tricas narras? quam tu virginem?
