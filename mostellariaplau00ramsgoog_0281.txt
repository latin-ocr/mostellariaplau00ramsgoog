dictum Capeto! a capite, quod sacerdotulae <in capite etiam nunc solent
habere,’' Varro L. L. V. § 130, ed. Mull. (iv. 29); and so Paul. Diae.
p. 57, ed. Mull, “ Capitol linteum quoddam quo in sacrificiis utebantur.”·
a. with sommus understood, Paul. Diae. p. 48, “Capetol facinus quod
capitis poena luitur.'’ Plautus has it twice; Men. l. i. 16, Numquam
edepol fugiet, tametsi capitol secm't,· and Merc. IV. iv. 26, C. Eutuclee
capr'tolsace's. E. Qui? C. Quia aequatem et sodalem, cahom luterum,
emmas. See also Lucil. ap. Non. s. v. capital, I. 175 (p. 38).

In the passage now before us, Weise‚ following the Ed. Prin. in
opposition to the best MSS, reads capitales aedis sacto est, which
he explains, “Capitalis autem hic est, propter crimen in ea commis·
sum quasi interdicta,” but he adduces no authority for such ameaning
of eupetalos. We lind indeed in Paul. Diac. p. 66, ed. Mull, “Capitalis
tumes, ubi, siquid violatum est, caput violatoris expiatur,'’ but this can
have no place here.

57. In the well known passage in Virgil G. 1.203, Non ole'ter
quom qui, tec, Aulus Gellius (X. 29) and Servius (ad. loc.) agree that
atque is equivalent to statem, and in the line now before us scholars
propose to translate atque by ‘forthwith' Ι do not however see that
this is necessary, and would render it simply ‘and then,' i. e. ‘the
next thing that happened was! There are however several passages
ln Plautus where the latter of two events connected by utque is repre-
sented as following so immediately upon the former that the conjunc·
tion may fairly be translated ‘forthwith3’ thus Bac. 11. iii. 45, Dum
m'rcunespecto, utque ego lembum conspice& Epid. 11. ii. 33, Quom od
pestum veneo, atque ego illam illic ordeo praestolorr'er,· Merc. 11. iil 17,
Nunc sirtica, ut res est, atque illum mihi me Emr'sse emloeo, quemadmodum
existumet me? Atque ellam apstrohot, tram more ln'm venum asportet ‚·
Capt. III. i. 19, Solvete mquam, Quo emus unu, umquam, od prandeum?
atque illi tacent,· to which we may add Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 17, i. 35 ; Trin.
111. ii. 433 but scarcely Poen. ΠΙ. iii. 38. ln Cas. Prol. 48 at seems
to be equivalent to statem3 and in Amph. 111. ii. 74 utque is most
conveniently translated by ‘but’

62. Illarum quim vigilanti diceret] ‘It is wonderful that the
man who was murdered sixty years ago did not tell his tale to my
master when wide awake‚’ the force being ‘Itis a very likely story, is
it not, that (the ghost of) aman who was murdered sixty years ago ,
would tell his tale to one who was vide awake l' Mirum quin implies
strong irony, and is employed to evince the impatient contempt felt
by the speaker for some statement or observation made or implied
by the person with whom he is conversing. Thus Amph. 11. ii. 118,
