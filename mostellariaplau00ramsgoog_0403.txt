The substantive circumductio is found in the same sense: Capt. V.
Cat. 3, Nec pueri supposttth, nec argmtr‘ circumductrb.

Ce'rcumvem‘re: Hec. Prol. 46, Ne eum ct'rcumventunt t'm'que r'ne'qur'
meedeant. ,

Circumire: Phor. IV. iii. 9, Tun denerat hnz'ce facinus indignum,
Chreme, Sr'c circumlui*

Ct'rcumvertere: Pseud. Ι. v. 12 5, Quid si hice mter se consenserunt,
Callipho, Aul de compacto saeuiunt consulis dolis, Qut nu argento circum·
vortant? Here the idea may be similar to that expressed in familiar
English when we talk ol ‘one person twisting another round his
finger,' and this leads us to observe that a great number oi curious
phrases, which express iraud and trickery, represent the person
deceived as an object animate or inanimato, as the case may be,
under the absolute control os the deceiver, who can deal with him
as he pleases.

13. Vendere. Venalis. Thus he is sometimes said ‘to be sold,'†
as a master might dispose ol a slave: Bac. IV. vii. 1⁶, C. ’0 stulte,
stulte, nescis nunc venene ted Atque in eo ipso adstas lupide, ubi praeco
praedicat. N. Responde, quis me uendi? When slaves were sold by
auction they were made to stand upon a stone, to elevate them above
the crowd, so that they might be distinctly seen by intending pur·
chasers. Cicero refers to this practice (In Pison. 15) when he calls
Serranus and Numerius duos de lapide emptos tribunos. Again, Mil. ΙΙ.
yi. 97, Me hubent uenalem: sentiet ehmdudune scio, Numquam hercle
exeita nassa ego bodie escam petam, ‘they are selling me; assuredly
1 shall not nibble the hait out os that trap to·day.’

14. Suble‘nere s. Oble'nere os. According to a favourite figure, he

is represented as a helpless drunkard who falls asleep at abanquet
and has his sace blackened by his componimus-a practica] johe by
no means unknown in our own dayi Thus Merc. 11. iv. 17, Vin
patri subltnere pulcre me os tuo? ‘to befool your father handsomely ;'
Aul. IV. vi. r, Ft'dei censebant maxumam multo fidem Esse, ea sublevit

* Circumire is sometimes quoted from Pseud. 111. ii. 109 in this sense,
but upon referring to the passage it will be seen that here it may simply
mean ‘he is going about!

†Mark the identity with English modern slang, to sa nothing oi the
Shakespearian: ‘lt would maire a man as mad as ahud to be so bought

and sold,’ Comedy of Errors, 111. i.; ‘bought and sold Lord Talbot,' K. Hen. “

Vl. Part l. Act tv. iv.; and ‘Diccon, thy master is bought and solil,¹
Richd. 111. Act V. iii.
