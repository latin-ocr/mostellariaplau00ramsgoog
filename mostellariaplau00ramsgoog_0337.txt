auctoritas, ‘provided only he were a man of weight’ Cicero wishes
to qualify the expression Nerua philosophus as too comprehensive, and
to limit his assertion to those whose names carried auctoritas with
them. Cic. dc Senect.V11. p aa, Manent tugensis senibus, mado per·
maneat studrum et andustrua, ‘provided only ε’ here again modo fixes
alimit to the proposition manent ungenta senibus, which would not be
true unless thus restricted. Phor. 1. ii 17, is senen per pustulas
Peraea, moda nan montes auri pollicens, ‘only not promising,’ ‘pro-
mising everything short of whole hills of gold,’ ‘the only limit to his

acertain amount of impatience or indignation is implied: so As. V.
