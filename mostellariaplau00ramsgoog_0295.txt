162 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

speaking olfac, says Primus annonis latio aaa, magno argumento
i‘n adoreae donis, sicuti dirimam· palte autem non pone οἰκίαι longo
tempore Romanos mandatum, quoniam et pulmentaria hodieque deantur
....Et hodie sacra prisea atque natalium pulte srititla conficiantur,
uidenturque tam picti i'gnota Graeciae secisse quarn Italiac polenta.
Respect for a great name must not allow us to hesitate in rejecting
the explanation of Scaliger, who would make the pultiphagus opi cx
barbarus a Carthaginien artificer, because mention is frequently made
in the Roman writers of carpentry work executed by the Cartha-
ginians. See notes on Varr. R. R. 111. 7.

IV. i. 5. Exercent sese ad cursuram] i. e. ‘they train themselves in
running! Cf. Stich. 11. i. 34, Simulque ad eiirsiiram meditabor mc
ad ludos Olympiae ‚· see also As. Il. ii. 61, Bae. 1. i. 34, Metal. 10,
Trin.1V.ii. 164, iii. 9.=

ιγ. Plagigericlus and Plagi'ger are tn. lq, each being found once
in Plautus. The latter occurs Pseud. 1. ii. ao, Huc adhi'bctc aures,
quae ego loquar, plagi'gera genera tlomi'rium. Plagipotida, which also
is a vox Plautina, occurs twice: above, ΙΙ. i. 9, lbi sunt isti plagi·
putidae, ferritribaces oi'ri,· and again, Capt. 111. i. ra, Nil morantur
iam Laconas, imi supsetti viros, Ptagipatidas, quitus sinit acrba sirie
pmii etpecunia.

aa. die erasini] i. e. die crastim, crac. Aulus Gellius, X. 24,
states that the forms die qiiarti', quina, narii} pri'stini' (for pridie),
traiani, maximi, and the like were employed exclusively by Cicero
and his predecessors instead of die quarto, quinto, nono, pristim, tic,
which afterwards came into general use, and that the older combi-
nation was frequently used by Augustus in bis letters. He adds tliat
the ancients said indifferently die quarti or quarte, quinti or quinte, the
words die quarti, tic, being prouounced as one, and regarded as an
adverb nith the second syllable short. He quotes from the Mimiambi'

of Cn. Matius, whom he characterises as ‘impense doctus,’ two lines
to prove that die quarto was considered by him equivalent to nudi'm
quartus, and arrives at the conclusion that die quarto properly refers
to past time, and die quartini quarte to future nme. See also

Macrob. S. Ι. 4. In Plautus we find, Men. V. ix. 94, Mas. l'i's con-
clamari auctionem J'orer' Quidiet Ma. Dic septimi. Mes. Auctio fiet
Menaechmi mane sane septimi,· and Pers. 11. iii. 7, Nam herus mciis mc

Eretriam misit, domitos boves icti sibi mercarer Dedit argentum: riam .

ibi mercatum delcit csse die septimi.
⁷ 24· Postrema] lt is a little difficult to catch the precise force of
this word in dialogue ; here it seems to be equivalent to ‘Well well,
