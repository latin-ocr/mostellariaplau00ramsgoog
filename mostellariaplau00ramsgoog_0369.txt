236 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

nrinrir is not an adverb, but the ablative of mirzius with argento or
some such word understood, ‘the house does not appear to you to
have been purchased at too long a price, does itr’

Nimio used as an adverb seems not to occur in Terence.

lxnn-SODES, SIS pl. S VLTIS, AMABO, QVAESO,
OBSECRO.

These five words are employed by the dramatists in the sense of
‘pray‚’ ‘prithee,' ‘it you please} ‘I beg of you,' ‘I beseech you,’
‘l implore you! We may make a few remarks upon each.

l. Soder was regarded by the Romans themselves aa a con-
traction of si audes: thus Cic. Orat. XLV. §154, Libenter etaiam
copulando verba tangebant, ul ‘sodes' pro ‘troaden’ ‘sir’ pro ‘sivri,·'
and Festus, s. v. sultis, p. 343, ed. Mau, “Surae si voltis significat,
composito vocabule, ita ut alia sunt, rodes, sr'audes, ris, ri vr's,' &o

The uncontracted form is found Trin. ll. i. 17, Da malti hoc, mel
meunt, ri me amas, sr'audes,· and in Aul. 11. i. 48, as the line is quoted
by Priscian, p. 960. ed. Puts, Dic mihi, sr' audes, quai· ea ert quam vr's
ducere uxorem? where however our MSS. of Plautus give quaeso
instead of ri audes.

Generally speaking, sodes is used without much emphasis: thus
Bac. lV. vii. 39, C. Novistine hominem? N. Novi. C. Dic sodes
milri, Bellan’ valletur specie multer? N. Admodum, i. e. ‘pray, tell me,'
or ‘tell me, if you please ;' and so Men. 111. iii 21, Trin. 11. iv. 161,
Pers 11. v. 17.

lt is a formula of civility in Hec. V. i. 27, sed scria quid volo poleas
rodes sacras? ie. ‘if it so please you3’ and so Heaut IV. iv. 16,.
Phor. V. vii. 28.

There is considerable earnestness in Adel. lV. v. 9, dic sodes,
pater, ‘tell me, I entreat you 3' and in Hec. V. iv. 1, Vide, mi Par·
meno, ettam sodes, i. e. ‘pray‚ be careful;' while there is something
soothing or deprecatory in Phor. V. iii. 10, Parce sodes; and coaxing
in Poen. ΙΙΙ. v. 12, Mine ad me sodes, drc, and in Trin.11. i. 17.
For other examples of sodes see Adel. lV. i. 1, Andr. I. 'u 58,
Heaut. lll. i. 50, iii. 19, lV. iv. 16, v. aa, Hec. 111. ii. 23, V. iv. 4,

Phor. V. i. 14· See also Catuli. CIII. 1, Cic. Epp. ad Aa. VII. 3, .

Hor. S. I. ix. 41, Epp. 1. i. 62, vii. 15, XVI. 31, Ad Pisones 438.
It will be observed from the above examples that sodes usually
follows an imperative, but this is not the case invariahly‚ as may be
