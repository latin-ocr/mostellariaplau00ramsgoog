lxii PROLEGOMENA.

Priscian (p. 1326) takes a totally different view oi tbese verses;
“Terentius trochaico mixto vel confuso cum iambico utitur in
sermone personarum, quibus maxime imperitior hie convenit, quem
puto ut imitetur hane confusionem rhythmomm iacere. Sunt autem
trimetri ae plus minusque, et habent penultimam versus syllabam in
quibusdam longam, et in quibusdam breve, ut in Audria'’ He then
quotes the first sour lines quoted above, and then goes on, “ Haec
sequitur dimeter catalecticus finiendi sermonis causa, quem ad Ar·
chillida habuit ;
Date, ntox ego huc revertor.

Similiter Plautus in Truculento eodem metro usus est in sermone
ancillae Astapbii ;¹

Adsunt-auscultate, alque aeternale aedes,

Ne quis adventor grambr abeat atque adsentiat,

Neu quis manus attulerit steriles thiro ad nos,

Gravtiias sores exportet, novi ego homiaem mores.’'

The lines to which he refers in Plautus (True. 1. ii. seqq.) are called
by Weise Saturnian!

We may now proeeed to diseuss in detail all the Bacchiae Verses
in the Mostellaria. The pectdiarities which these exhibit in their
structure will, when explained, be sufficient to enable the intel-
ligent student to examine ior himself those which appear in other
plays.

A number oi Bacchiacs occur iu Aet. 1. ii. r seqq, and these we
shall give according to the arrangement os Hermann, noting the
changes which he has introduced into the text, which are neither
numerous nor important. It is to be understood that the whole oi
these lines are Tetrameters Acataleetic, except such as are specially
noted as belonging to a different species-

υ. r. Molossus in and place.

v. 2. Molosstis in rst and 3rd. Institui, the reading oi the
MSS, was changed by Reizius into rirstrlt'rn', a form analogous to
parthi, from pono.

v. 3. Pure.

v. 4. Pure, but the MSS. have eam rent volutam, which seans
equally well is we pronounce deit as a monosyllable, and make a
Molossus in the 4th place: hence any change seems quite un-
necessary.

a. 5. ATrimeter Aeat with Ionie a minore in rst, followedby
two Molossi.
