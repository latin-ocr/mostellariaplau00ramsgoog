11. diorum odire oli'cui', ‘to disappoint,' ‘to frustrate,' ‘to beiool,’
‘to deceive: ‘to play a trick upon' This phrase was probably
suggested by the play among children 01 stretching out a hand con·
taining some object as il to present it to a person, and then, when
the victim‘ 01 the johe is about to take the object, suddenly with·
drawing the hand: thus Aul. 11. viii. 8, Ito i'lli‘s impuris oniuc'bies odii'
ieonum, ‘l disappointed all those filthy lellows-imstrated their
designs 3’ Cas. V. ii. 54, Qiu'd nuuc? 111111 lepide odito est eobi's manus?
‘haven't you been cleverly jockeyedi’ Poen. ll. 11, Eo pacto ouoroe
Veneri pulcre adei' monum· and v. 16, Quom sci'burit, Veneri' 111 oderri't
leno monum· Pers. V. ii. 18, Vince iri tricas comrci'sti'! Quomodo de
Persa nionus ntt'hi' odila 1111 ln the last-quoted example we have
com'cere i‘n tri'cos, ‘to entangle in 2 net ;’ and so lV. i. 9, Nunc ego
lenonem i'to leodi'e iritri'cotum dabo, Vr 1111111 1111 quo 11 expediri 11111111.

12. Circum. Verbs eompounded with circum frequently irnply
that 2 person is ‘led round,’ that is, not straight 10, but away from,
an object which he wishes to reach, or, that one person ‘gets round'
another, that is, takes him 21 disadvantage by coming upon him from
behind. Such verbs are frequently used in the general sense 01 ‘to
deceive,’ ‘to cheat:' thus circumducere, construed with the accu-
sative 01 the person cheated, to which is generally added the ablative
01 the thing out ol which he is cheated: thus As. l. i. 83, Quo me, quo
uxorem, qua tu servom Sauream Potes, circumduce, ausm· Truc. IV.
iv. 21, Triduom 1111111111, dum oli'qiio mi'les circumduciiur; Pseud. 11.

Quadringentis Philippii filius mc 11 crematus circumduxerunt. Irt
Poen. V. v. 7 circumducere and tongere are combined: Si'c dedero:
uere moltiori tetigero lenunculum,· Nactus 111 homiriem, miro quem
argenti circumduceret: other examples 01 circumducere in Pseud. l. v.
16, Trin lV. ii. 17. There is a curious anacoluthon with circum·
ducam in Pseud. l. v. 115, but perhaps the passage is corrupt.
