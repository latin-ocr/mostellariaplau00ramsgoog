munden, Ι have had to follow my own judgment, 1 will de-
scribe more partimlarly the condition of some portions of the
MS. as 1 found it.

The text, fortunately, was lest in a completed state. lt is
Rmnded almost entirely, as the reader will perceive, upon the
readings of the Vatican MS„ and especially B, with such
assistance as can be obtained from A, whose authority is of
course pararmunt in all those cases where its evidence is
available.

The critical apparatus has been derived partly from printed
editions, but also in part from an original collationi of the
MS. themselves5 and the chief value of this edition, in
a critical point of view, will be found in the circumstance

examined the celebrated Milan Palimpsesn The result of
these labours is to be found partly in the Prolegomena, partly
in the critical notes, which embrace a considerable number of
readings not recorded hy Ritscffl, a-nd in some few instances

cluded in the copy of the text as 1 found it, have been incor-
porated by myself; and in several cases, where 1 felt uncertain
as to the exact meaning or reference of the MS. notes in my
hands, 1 was enahled to set doubt at rest by a careful persona]
examination of the Vatican Mss. in June, 1867, when I had the
satisfaction of testing the perfect accuracy of every statement
made in this edition as to the readings and condition of those

considerable difficulty, It will be observed that in the Pro-
legomenz the more important points of doubt in connection
with this subject are discussed at length⁷ and in many cases a
decision arrived at as to the modes of spelling particulas forms
and words, which we may, from the evidence of inscriptionS,
