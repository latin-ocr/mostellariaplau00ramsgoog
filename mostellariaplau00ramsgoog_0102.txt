which is sometimes referred to as an example of v dropped, it is
scarcely possible ιο sean it as it stands, md Parem ia probably
right when he proposes ιο omit eliam altogether⁴

The example os ἦν wntracted, quoted from Aul. Prot 5, dependa
upon m unnecessary change in the reading os the best MSS. In
Amph. 1V. iii. 15 (T roch. Ten. Can),

Seu ῥαίνω rive avon« videbo ΙΙ opnmabo ιἰι aedibus,

we may either consider am as n monosyllnble, or ,ἶιΐι u a mono-
syllable and totally elided. Α good example ol* ἀΐω aa n monosyllable
occurs in Men. Prol. ⁴4 (Senam),

ΕΙ xpi-u eodm er! ἴω· vocans nomine,

3· But this shortening or cont-*action taken place in the middle
ot many words without the presence os the letter v. Thus aspero,
circula. manipulus, gubernaculo, oramla, saecula, pericula, mhnla,
laminae, and many others become aspro, circlos, maniplu, gubernaclo,
oratla. sacch, pericla, vinela! lamnae* This takes place most sre-
quently when ι short vowel in the middle os n word is sepnnted
from mother vowel by a liquid, as in the above examples3 but this
is by no means a necessary condition, sur we find caldior sor calMsbr,
puertia for pueritia, unversun sor antima-m, calfit-1⁴1 sur calfiril,
and Quintilian 1. ⁶, tells us thaz in his time falsati! was more
common than calefim't.

4. Other contractans. When e is followed by mother vowel in
the same word, it frequently coalesces wilh it in dactylis verse,
generally, though not unisormiy, from necessity. Thus we have ιιιιγΐα,
uveam, e-adem, mim, rexpoadfmus, asra, ama, serra, aem,
αιιηῖ, ἴυᾰιηι, effidem⁴

So also oo is canu-acted in such words as camenus, (apertius.
