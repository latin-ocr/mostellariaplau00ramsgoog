II.-THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF PLAUTUS.

Every one who is familiar with the textos Plautus, as presented
in the printed copies, must be struck by the differences which it
exhibits in orthography. Not only does he detect these discrepancies
in the more important editions, when compared with each other, but
he often finds the same word appear under a different form in the
same edition, in the same play, and even in lines almost consecutive.
Nor will he be able to discover any fixed principle by which editors
have been guided They seem to have followed at one time one
guide, at another time another, and not unsrequently to have partially
adopted some system founded upon their own individual views oi
grammar and etymology. This is most perplexing to ayonng scholar.
It seriously embarrasses and retards his progress, and the labour
necessary to master the difficulties, when unattended by any sure
result, proves most irksome, because his memory is severely taslied
without the conviction that his mind has been beneficially exercised.
It is clearly desirable to put an end to this state os things More
than one method may be pursued.

r. We may endeavour to restore the orthography os the Latin
language as it existed during the third century B.C., and to reproduce
the lines of Plautus exactly as we may suppose them to have pro·
ceeded from the pen of the author. Every one acquainted with the
subject will at once admit that this is simply impossible3 that we
have no means at our disposal which would enable us to accomplish
such an object.

2. We may content ourselves with adopting what may be called
the standard orthography os Latin, which, although varying slightly
according to the views oi scholars upon particular points, is sub·
stantially the same in all the leading editions ol the classim, and was
probably formally adjusted during the first century os the Empire.
This is perhaps the most simple plan, and is open to fewer objections.
The learner is not discouraged by encountering urmecessary obstacles,
and he carr investigate the questions connected with the early history
and orthography ol the language when he has advanced farther in
his studies. Moreover, this is the course which we here ourselves
have adopted with regard to our own Shalrespeare.

3. There is however yet another path open,a sort os cuir medin,
and this is the one which 1 leel inclined to follow. lt can be proved
