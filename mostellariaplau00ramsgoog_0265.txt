132 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Pseud. l. i. 99. Observe that in Mil. II. vi. 35, postulare tecum sig·
nifies ‘to complain os you,' ‘to accuse you;' and so postulant, Cas.
ΙΙΙ. ii. 26. See also Bac. III. iii. 38, 45.

διο4. Purpurrssumj ‘Rouge.' It was made by boiling fine chalk
with the purple dye obtained from the murex. Plin. H. N. XXXV.
6, j 26, E reliquis coloribus quos a dominis dari dratinus propter mag-
nitudinem pretr' ante omnes es! purpurissum. Creta argentariis curu
purpuris puriter tr'rrgur'tur bibitque eum colorem celerrirs Iunis. cf.
XXXV. 6, j 12. The sorrn purpurisso is quoted by Non. p. 218,
from the Sanniones ol Naevius, Inlr'rro crelam, cerussam, purpurissum.
Plautus uses also the participial adjective purpurissatas, Truc. 11. i.
35, Quia adm sores nostras unguentis unctu es ausa accedere, (juraque
istas buccas tant belle purpurissatas habes.

105. Interpolare] This verb is found only in the form of a
compound, but we can scarcely doubt that the simple polo is derived
from the same root as polin The true meaning oi the word seems
to be ‘to renovate,' ‘to surbish up,’ ‘to change the appearance os an
object,' the idea being usually implied that this is effected by the
addition os something which enters into combination with the original
object. It is said to have been properly a term describing the

operations performed by fullones in cleaning woollen gannents‚ and .

this explanation is supported by a passage in Cic. Epp. ad Q. F. ΙΙ.
xii. 2, when speaking oi Antiochus ol Commagene; Quod vult, irr-
quam, renovare honores eosdem, quominus togam praetextam quotanmi
r'rrterpolet, decernendum nihil censeo, i. e. ‘to save him from furbishing
up his old toga praetexta ever yearf* Vestr'menla r'rrterpola in the
Digest XVIII. 1, j 45 are opposed to nova. Cf. XXI. i. 37.
Hence it signifies ‘to clean’ simply, without the notion os adding
anything‚ as in Plin. H. N. XII. 14, § 32, Ar, Hercules, Alexandriae,
ubi tura r'rrrcrpoluntur. The meaning os the expression in Aul. IV.
ias is very doubtful. Ol the word used in the general or figurative
sense os ‘to invest an object with a new aspect! we have a good
example in Amph. 1. i. 160, where Mercury, addressing his own
clenched fist, observes, Alr'a forma oportet esse, quem tu pugno legeras,-
to which Sosia rejoins, Illic homo me rhtcrpolabr't, ruuntque os finget
denum· and in Cic. in Verr. Act. 11. i. 61, j 158, Hoc modo iste sibi et

soluti suar prospicere driir'crl, referendo in tabulas et pravatus r! publicas

* lt is well known that rogae were cleaned and whitened by rubbing in
clralk or pipo-clay3 hence the phrases (Livy lV. 2 5) album in vestimentum
addere periuriis . . . causa, and (Pers. V. 177) cretata ambitio. Compare

Plin. H.N. XXXV. ¹7 j 57.
