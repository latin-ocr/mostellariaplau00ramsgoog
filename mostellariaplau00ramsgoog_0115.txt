xcviii PROLEGOMENA.

So the MSS. Guyetus and R. get rid of the difficulty by transposing,
and have entre moda.

We occasionally find violent transgressions of quantity depending
upon a single example ; thus Aul. III. v. 42,

Strophrarr'e‘ adstant, adstant semeaonarri',

where, if we retain the Vulgate, we must shorten the two first
syllables in sientammrr'e'. Nothing is more likely than that a cor·
ruption should be found in this passage, where there is along string
of strange words invented apparently for the nonce. Bothe has pro·
posed a simple emendation-

Strophiarr'e’ stant, stant semesonare‘r',

but the word remisonorei‘ itself is very doubtful.

[Having thus shown that little or no reliance can be placed on
the above examples as affording evidence that the early dramatists
had no scruple in violating the Rule of Position, wherever it suited
the exigencies of their verse todo sn, we will proceed to give a few
examples of lines containing one or other of the two classes of anoma-
lies referred to above, phur, and which we have sufficiently indicated
are in our opinion to be scanned by the process called ‘correption,’
that is, by slurring over and running together two syllables into one,
. rather than by an indiscriminate neglect of the fundamental Law of
Position.-E1>.] '

Ι. Under class 1, consisting chiefly of dissyllables with a short
penultimate, we may instance the following :-

Apud must be pronounced as a monosyllable in Epid. 111. iv. 14
(Senam),

Memorare! affl reges armis arte droelle'ea,

where it will be observed that the two first syllables of drnllr'co suffer
synizesis; again, in Amph. 111. ii. 66 (Senam),
Vt quae opud legionem vota voni se' domum.

Other instances will be found in Capt. 1. ii. 90, Cure. 11. iii. 66, Most.
Ι. ἱίἱ. 141.
Enim is a monosyllable Trin. Ι. ii. 2³ (Senam),
Namque omn tu credo mihi imprudenti obrepserat.

So the lllSS.; Camer. has numquam ene'en, and R. correcte nempe
enain. In Trin. Ι. iii. 77 (senar.) we have both em'm and nemis as
monosyllables,

Ita saetam-At emme nitens lango sermone utemur.
