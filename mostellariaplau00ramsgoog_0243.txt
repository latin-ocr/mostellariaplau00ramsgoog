· llourished aster Augustus, as Freund asserts in his Lericon, ior Varro
R. R. ΙΙΙ. ι7 says that Hortensius kept a body of tishermen in his
pay to lurnish the precious inhabitants os his ponda (piscinae) with

little tishes‚ and that when the weather was so tempestuous that they
could not bring to shore in their nets orbam sogr‘rraot, then he supplied
them with morsels os salted fish (salsamento), where orbam sagr'nam
must signisy ‘living iood,' in contradiction to the salsamenta or
pickled tunny.* Hence we have the verb rogitare, ‘to satten,' sogi-
natus and segebrandus· and Varro R. R. lll. ιο supplies us with the
term sagraarziam lor a ‘fattening coop! This being premised we
may pass on to examine the three passages in Plautus, in addition
to that before us, where the word is found. 1. Most. 1. iii. 78 (77),
Iam isia quidem apsumpia rer. erit, dics noctesque estur, hbriur Ne·
que quisquam parsimoniam adhr'bei,· sagrira plane est, which the older
commentators explain, ‘the place is a regular latting coop,' making
sagraazsaginarium. But this is quite unnecessary, and we may keep
to the strict sense, ‘it is a clear case oi stuffing and cramming!
Again, 2.Trin.111. ii 96, where Stasimus, speaking os his master as
about to enter the service oi some foreign prince, says, Aut aliquem
ad regem in saginant herus se coniecit meto, i. e. ‘in order that he may
grow iat at his cost;' and ve have a parallel to this in Cicero pro
Flacco VII, Nuper palata, paullo ante omni largitione saturati, Per-
gameni, quod Mithriioles, qui multiiula'nem illam non aucloriiate sed
rogaho tenebat, se velle erst'i, id sutores, id sororii conclamarant. cf.
also Tacit. H. ΙΙ. 7ι. 3. The third example is in Mil. llI. ii. 31,
where a dnmken slave, who had been stealing wine, says that if his
misdeeds are discovered, Postea sagita ego atior cellaria, where the
term sagraa cellaria, being evidently a whimsioal phrase coined to
raise a laugh, must not be pressed too closely. But none oi these
throw any light upon the phrase before us. B has sagriram caedra,
the rest cedria Lambinus adopts cedere and explains it daie, that is,
give me iood lor my oxen. But this would involve a false quantity,
for in that case cedrio must be regarded as equivalent to cette and g
connected with cido, ‘give me,' and then it would be impossible to
scan the line. Weise renders the words by cibos comedeia, than which
nothing could be more tarne. F orcellini finds away out os the difficulty
by assigning a special meaning to sagina, ol which this passage affords ,
the only example, viz. ipsum animal sagina pinquesactum, in which
case we might render the line, ‘eat, cram yourselves, slay the fatted

* The passage in Propert. lV. viii. ²5 is not decisive.
