aeque, oenum iret, on which Livy remarks, Hac lege ruris ritterpretes
negant quemquam sacrosanctum esse, sed eum qui eorum cuiquam moceurit

The theory seems to have been that any man who was solemnly made
over and devoted to aGod was thereby placed beyond the pale of
human sympathy and protection. It fs commonly asserted that an
individual under these circumstances was sacer dis auferri, but in both,
quotations given above where a God is named it Is Iupiter. See
Macrob. S. 111. 7. Sacer in the general sense of ‘worthless,' ‘good-
for·nothing,’ ‘vile,' was originally, as might be expected, applied to
persons only, and this is the case uniformly in Plautus and the earliest
writers (Bac. IV. vi. 14, Poen. Prol. 9ο, Rud. 1. ii. 69), but Catullus
applies the epithet to a book, XIV. 12, Di magui, horribilem et sacrum
libellum, and to a rank smell, LXXI. 1, Si quoi, Virro, bomo sacer
¹alarum obstitit hircus, while the auri sacra sames of Virgil (AEn III.
57) has passed into a proverb. With regard to the use of uuus in
the line before us we have an exact parallel in Truc. ll. i. 39, Sed est
·huic uuus seruos urblemtissumus.

Hercules was proverbial among the Romans. r. He was regarded ⁴

as the guardian of hidden treasures and those who discovered
such hoards were wont to ascribe their good fortune to the favour
of the God; thus Hor. S. 11. vi. ro, 0 si urnam argenti sors quae
mihi monstret, ut illi Thesauro rmoeuto qui mercenarius agrum Illum
ipsum mercatus aravit, arms amolo liercule,· and Pers. S. II. 10, 0
ei Sub rastro crepet argenti mihi serra, dextro Hercule. Indeed it
would appear that, according to popular belief, Hercules was looked
upon ln the same light as those spirits who in Eastem and Northem

mythology are supposed to dwell beneath' the earth, brooding over ’
and watching hidden gold; thus Acron explains the allusion in
Horace, Ideo quia thesauris praeest, ct sumt qui eundem incubonem esse
ueleitt, to which we may add the following curious notice in the tract
known to writers on Roman topography as Currbsum Vrbis Romae*

Bunsen, Beschreibung der S. R. Tom. l. p.175. It probably belongs to
the early part of the fourth century.
