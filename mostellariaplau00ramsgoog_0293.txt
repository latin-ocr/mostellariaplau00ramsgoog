emphasis, but was equivalent iu many cases to the indefinite article a
or an, which is In reality ane or mee, and was anciently employed
just as un, uno, ein, etc. are in modern languages. Plautus will afford
'several examples: in this play, IV. il. 67 (iii. 44), we have Vnus rimi
seruos est socerruneus,· and IV. iii. 9 (iv. 9), Vnum 'm'de' neortuom
efferre'fhras,· so Capt. 111. i. aa, unum ridiculum de'ctum,· Epid. III. iv.
17, Pol ego magri unum quaero, i e. ‘Iseek (some) one! In Trin. IV.
iv. 11, Curre in Piraeum, atque unum curriculum sace, which Weise
explains by saying “unum pleonastice ut saepius,” unum is highly
emphatic, ‘run to the Piraeus and make one course ol it,' ie. ‘do
not halt sor amoment! ln Pseud. i. i. 52 (q. w), nunc uuae quinque
remorantur mr'rrae may signisy ‘a matter os five minae‚’ but ureae is
here rather equivalent to solae or solum, ‘now the balance oi five minae
alone detains me here ;’ and so eres unos passus, Bac. 1v. vii. 34.

14¹1. Ducere, Duceare, Ce'rcumducere, Perductum, Perductor, all
occur in the same sense in the course oi this play. In Pers. IV.
iv. 85, Omne ego pro mittio esse ducto quodsue't quando suit, the MS.
reading ducto in this sense is an ᾶπ. lep. W reads duco.

Ill. ii. 10. Tota turget milti uxor] i. e. ‘is all in a ferment!

There is a lIne in Cas. 11. v. 17 which may serve as a commentam, ’

Nunc infermentatum est, ila turget mr'lte'.

η. medardum est mule] The same expression in As. IV. ii. 8⁶1,
Male cudendum est: audientum me uxor adduae domum.

79. Qemsiflage'tator] ie. ‘like a dun! See note on v. 55.

110. Se'ie'quisque ruri nichil] A proverbial expression equivalent
to ‘every one lor himself in this world' or ‘charity begins at home!
Compare Epid. 11. ii. 80, Mihi e’stic nec sere'tur rue metetur, i. e. ‘I
have no interest in that matter, it does not concern me!

111. Redhe'bere is a technical legal term employed when a

· purchaser returns the artIcle purchased upon the hands of the seller

on account ol some deiect. The explanation os Ulpian is perlectly
distinct (Digest XXI. 1, i 21), “Redhe'bere cst facere ut rursus habeat
venditor quod habuerit;'' and so Festus p. 270, ed. Muli, where
however the text is somewhat corrupt. The act oi returning an
object under these circumstances was called Redhe'bitio, and a suit
brought to compel the seller to receive the object and to return
the price was Actio Redhr'br'torriz, and so Iudicium Redielore’um. See „
Digest XXI. 1, j 18, 48, 54, ⁶o; see also Quintil. 1. 0. VIII 3,

’ §14; Aul. Geli. 1v.2, XVII. 6. Plautus employa the word again,
Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 84, Dixit se redhibere si non placeat, i.e. ‘he (the
purchaser) said that he would return her ii she did not give
