ORTHOGRAPHY. xxix

farei mendacei, perhaps to distinguish it from the ablative mendaci*
There is no reason to suppose that the proposals of Lucilius were
ever accepted and recognised iu practice; the use ol ei for i gra·
dually, although slowly, fell into disuse, and to the last we find no
consistency.

’ There are however a lew words in which, lor along period, ei
was uniformly employed

Foremost among these is the relative Qut, which, both in the nom.
sing. and nom. pl, appears almost invariably as Quae· down to the
beginning ol the eighth century.

QVEI in the nom. sing. occurs upwards ol two hundred times in
the inscriptions 1-19; QVI once only, viz. in 13 (EC. 117). In
20 QVEI occurs about fisty times, Qvl twice.

' QVEI in the nom. pl. occurs about sixty times in 1-20, QVI once

only, viz. in 18. QVEIQVOMQVE (sing. and pl.) appears first in
11, and in inscriptions 11-20 about twenty-six times without variation
SEI for SI occurs upwards oi seventy times in 1-203 SI once only,
via. in 14. QVASEI is found in 11,1a,1o, in all seven times;
QVANSEI, apparently a blunder‚† in 14; QVASI never. VTEI
appears first in 10, and in the inscriptions 10-20 upwards os ninety
times; VTI occurs five times, commencing with 11. In the in-
scriptions 10-20, IBEI, VBEI, ΝΕΙ, ΝΕΝΕ, occur more fre·
quently than 1131, VBI, NE, NEVE, but 1131, NE, NEVE are by
no means uncommon.

CEIVIS seems to have long maintained its ground. It is found
in 10, and in the inscriptions 10-14 CEIVIS and its cases, spelled
with ei in first syllable, occur about lourteen times ; CIVES appears
lor the first time in 16.‡ CEIVITATE occurs four times in 12.
So in the inscriptions 11-19 DEICO occurs nearly thirty times:
viz. DEICAT three times, DEICERENT once, DEICET eight
times, DEICITO eleven times, DEICVNTO twice, DEICERE
once, DEICEI twice, DEICVNDO once. DICERE, DICITO
appear first in 20; the sorms DIXI and DEIXI, with their
derivativas, were used indifferently.

*Varro also appears to have attempted to lay down rules upon the
satbryrceu subject (Terent. Scaur. l.c.), but the words of Scaurus are very
ο re.

†[Does not this spelling rather allord a trace ol the original form
of the word, qaam sl :tl—En]

1 ClVlBVS is quoted from 14, but there is a flaw in tlre tablet at the
commencement oi the word.
