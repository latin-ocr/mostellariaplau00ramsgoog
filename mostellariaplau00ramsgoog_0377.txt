One or two phrases connected with money and money payments
require some explanation.

(a) Commodus denotes that a sum mentioned is ‘of full weight;'
Rud. V. ii. 31, Talentum argenti commodum magnum inerat-r'n crumena,·
and As. III. iii. 135, Quid ego aliud exoptem amplius, nisi illud quotics
inopia est, Viginti argenti commodas minos hairu quas dem matri? and
Mese. Il. iii. ror, where the father and son are bidding in opposition,
each pretending to be the agent of a friend, D. Etiam nunc adnutat:
addam sex manas. C. Septem milti (Numquam edepol me vincet hodie)
commodis poscit, pater.

Modicus seems to be employed in the same sense, Pseud. IV. vii.
r 30, B. Perdidit me. S. Ar me uiginti mediiis multavit numi.

(b) Probatus again indicates that the purity of the metal in the
coin or bullion had been tested; thus Pers. IV. vi. r, Prolati laic
argenti sunt sexaginta mrum, with which compare 111. iii. 33.

(c) When Labrax says, Rud. 111. iv. 21, Tu, senex, si estas amos,
luc arsita argento est opus, the phrase is probably equivalent to ‘hard
cash :' the explanations given by the older commentatore are fanciful,
not to say n'dIculous.

(d) Among the smaller denominations the Trrbbolun Is frequently
mentioned, generally indefinitely for a very small sum, as in Rud. V.
ii 43, when Gripus is asked how much he demands for giving the
information sought, he replies, Talentum nmgnum, non potest matrum
lvr'm abesse, ‘a taient, not a farthing less ;’ and lower down, o. 67,
Non illi ego lodr‘e debeo triobolum, ‘I don’t owe him a farthing:’ see
also Bac. II. iii. 2⁶, Poen. lv. ii. 4⁶, Rud. IV. iii. 100, V. iii. 11: in
like manner Poen. 1. ii. 168, Non ego ltomo trioboli sum, nisi ego illi
mastigiae Exlurbo oculos alque dentes, ⁴1 am a man not worth a
sarthing if ’ &c.; and the same expression recum, II. 17.

(e) Drabolaris, an adjective, is found in Poen. 1. ii. 58, and Frag.
Cistell. ap. Van. L. L. VIII. 64, ed. Mtlll See also Paul Diae.
s.v., p. 74, ed. Muli.

II. Plrr‘lippau s. lt'unrus Philippeos. The coinage of Athens and of
the rest of Greece may be said to have consisted of silves and copper
exclusively up to 350 ΒΩ, for although gold was occasionally minted
before that period, it was issued in very small quantities, and the
circulatIon was necessarily extremely limited. About the time however -
indicated above, Philip Il of Macedon, the father of Alexander the
Great, obtained such large supplies of gold from the mines ol Thrace
that during the remaindcr of his lise he struck enormous numbers of
gold coins, which were speedily dispersed all over the world. These
