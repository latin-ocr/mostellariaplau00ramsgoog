EXCVRSVS XIV.-TALENTl‘'M, MINA, bc. 249

with reference to their own currency, signifies κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, the Numus
Sestertium But the daily pay of the Roman soldier was certainly
not three Sesterb'i at this period.

a. Plautus, Pseud. 1. i 95, makes Calidorus say, Quid ego ni fleam
Quoi nec parabus numus argenti siet, Neque cuilibellae spes sil usquam
gentilem-iram which we naturally infer that the numus argenti is
something different srom the libell. But the Libello, according to
Varro (L. L. V. ξ 174, ed. Milli), was a small silver coin equal in
value to the copper As. Hence we may translate, Ἰ, who have not
got a shilling in my pocket, and have no hope ol procuring a penny
anywhere! It is quite true that libella is employed elsewhere (as it
is indeed here) by Plautus in the same sense as triobolum and numus,
to denote indefinitely a triding sum, as in Cas. II. v. 8, Quod si tu
nolti, filiasque eliam luas, Vobis emoriri alque amborum rhgralr'r's Vna
libella liber possum fieri;* and that when Hegio says, Capt. V. i. 27,
A! ob eam rem mibi libellam pro eo argentine dur's, the meaning is
precisely the same as when he says, II. ii. 81, Eum si reddis mebi,
praeterea unum ππππππ ne dur's,· but our obiect at present is to ascer-
tain whether the value ol the numus, when used by Plautus to denote
a specific sum or coin, is constant or variable.

3. Lastly, as to the passage illast. ΙΙ. i. ro. When Lipsius and
others assert that the words trram numerum causa refer to the daily
pay ol the Roman soldier, even if we were to admit that the words
really allude to the pay ol the Roman soldier, it is a pure assumption
to take it ior granted that his daihr pay is meant. Supposing the tres
numi equivalent to six drachmae or six denarii (ior, as we remarked
above, the Roman writers are wont to regard the drachma and the
denarias as equivalent), the tres numi would be equal to 60 asses, or two
asses per day sor a month. That this may have actually been the pay
ol the Roman soldier when Plautus wrote is by no means improbable,
since it was only two obols or 3} asses per day in the time oi Polybius,
although the wealth oi Rome and the importance ol her armies had
increased enormously during the interval. This is amere conjecture,
and may be taken lor what it is worth, but we must bear in mind
that we have no prooi whatsoever that the words ol Tranio refer to
the pay os a Roman soldier. That three numi were occasionally given

* 'So again, Pseud. ΙΙ. ii. 3.⁴’ ribi libellam argenti numquam endam. No
{battellariiitlltnd‘hltlbtlltrtaabablium
the words oi Varro (hc.) are perfectly distinct—“ Numi denarii deiuma
libella, quod libram pondo aeris valebat, et erat ex argento parva.”
