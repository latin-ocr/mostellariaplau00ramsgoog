to undergo Capu'lir ominum. This being premised, the mimive
Cafitalsi· when employed with reference to (a) and (3) may be applied
ιο what fflects the phyn'eal 1372, or to what affeetu the poln'tr'ml list.
1. As nfl'ecfing the physin! lise it significo literaliy ‘dendlf or
‘dangerous to life,¹ and in this sense it occurs in Mil. 11. iii. ²3·
Tus} ‚me mribus capitique frauda capitalem hinc mas, te. *you
are raising up ι deudly injury to limh and lires so capiuli ex
periculo, Rud. 11. iii. r9; vectas capitali peni-uh, Trin. IV. lii. 81;
and figuratively, Pom. 1v. ii. 57, Stei- ιιι herum tuum mco hero
em amiam capitalem, te. ‘a deadly enemy;¹ m ira cuffiam in
Hor. S. 1. vii. ¹3: and odium capitalae in Cicero de Am. r. Hence
Capilalis signifies ‘terrihlef ‘arcemn‘ as in the passage now
before us, aad in Adei ιν. vii. 3, D. Fero alia flegma aa te tn-
genlt'a Boni illius aduisa-emtis. M. Em aulea. D. Nova, Capimia,
i.e. ‘ntrcueictuiu¹ and so in Cicero we have capitulu- oroeltb, capi-
tam immam, capuam ιι pestfirm Annum* aarum, and even
caparalis hm. ². Aa affecung the ponuat ure capitam is ex-
tensively employed with regard ιο criminal proceedings. Sinoe the
punishment sor some erimiml offences vus dent-h, but sor a much
larger class was some pennlty which entailed capilii deminum, the
phnses res capilum, causa [κήκιε utinen capitale, iudicium capi-
tale, poena eafflssalnk, taken by themselves, are ambiguous, aud their
soree must iu ench ease be dem-minet! by the context. They
may signify ι ‘capim' charge trial or punishment, mording ιο the
English soree os the term in such cases, but much more frequently
they indicate merely a charge trial or punishment affecting the poli-
tical privileges but not the life of the person implicated. 3. Since
nnyrhing which affectu either the physicas or political life ol an
individunl is of serious importance w him, capitali} oecuiomuy
significa 'os pasamount important-,es und so we mzy take Stich. 111.
ih 4⁶. Eam auspicavi ego fn re capitali mea, ‘upon her 1 depended sor
m omen when au my best iuterests were nt suthe? ι. Occasionally,
Capilalis is round in the sense of ‘excellent,¹ as when we talk of
‘a capital speech: 'a capital dinner,’ or the like; thus Ovidi Fun
111⁴ ⁸3⁹3 Cic. ad Q. F. 11. ης Trebell. Poll. XXX. Tyranm ro; all
os which are quoted in Foreellini.

Before quini-13 Capitalis we must nou‘oe Capitol, which is used as
n substantive, but zppears to be merely the abbreviated form of the
neuter capitale. 1oe is used 1. with Iinleum, veslimmtum, mlum or some
such word understood, to signisy a naplrin worn upon the head by

priestesses. '¹ Item texta fasciola qua capillum in capite nlligurent
