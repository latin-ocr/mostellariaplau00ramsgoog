lxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

employed in our own language, and the corresponding Latin term
decennes by several continental writers. in popular language the
terms ottenb, Accml, and Emphasri, although perfectly distinct,
are frequently confounded but all who employ precise and scientific
language understand that Accenl applies only to that elevation or
deprcssion of tone which correspond to what are tenned high and
low notes in music. lt is by the proper application oi accent that
we prevent reading or recitation from becoming monotonous‚ but
this has no necessary connection whatever with the quantity ol a
syllable, which depends solely on the time that the voice dwells
upon it in comparison with other syllables.

But while several modern grammarians have vainly imagined that
the quantity of a syllable might be influenced by the accent, Bentley
introduced fresh complicatione and tell into the strange mistalre ol
coniounding the Acute Accent with the Ictus Mettius, which has by
some writers been most unfortunately termed the lllctrr'cal Accent.
This phrase, Ictus Metricos, it is now universally admitted, was ern·
ployed by grammarians to denote the stress which must be laid upon
certain syllables in repeating verse in order that the rhythmos the
measure may be made perceptible to the ear. In Dactylic verse
theletus falls upon the first syllable oi the Dactyl andos the Spondee;
in Iambic verse, on the long syllable of the Iambus and the second
syllable os the Spondee3 in Trochaic verse, on the long syllable oi
the Trochee and the first syllable oi the Spondee. When sectare
resolved, the Ictus maintains its place, and hence in Iambic verse the
Ictus ialls on the second syllable of the Tribrach‚ the second syllable
oi the Dactyl, and the last syllable oi the Anapaest; in Trochaic verse,
on the first syllable of the Tribrach‚ the Dactyl, and the Anapaest.
That the Ictus Metricus has not in itsels any connection with quantity
is evident from what has been stated above, that it ialls according to
the verse, sometimes upon the first and sometimes on the second
syllable oi the Spondee‚ on the first or second oi the Dactyl, and on
the first or second ol the Tribrach. of the two syllables oi the
Spondee‚ which are, in so far as quantity is concamed, equally long,
the first receives theletus in Dactylic verse, and the second in Iambic
verse, while one oi the short syllables of the Dactyl has the Ictus in
Iambics, and one of the short syllables ol the Anapaest in Trochaics.
That it has no connection with the Acute Accent or Accent proper
is equally evident from the fact that in polysyllables the Acute Accent
can sall only on the penultimate or antepenultimate, while in innu-

merahle instantes the lctus must fall upon the last syllable. Bentley
