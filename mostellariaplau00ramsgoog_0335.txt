Imo ιι salas is acombination in which ιἰιιι is said to have some·
times the iorce οι ‘yes' used as a direct affirmative. But ιι we

'have not been interpreted correctly: thus Eun. 11. iii. 61, Parmeno
is describing to Chaerea the gift presented to Thais, C. Quis ι“ι ιιι
tarn potens ιιιιιι tanto munere hoc? P. Miles Ἠιιαιι Phaedrae rriralr's.
’0. Duras fratris partes praeditas. P. Into enim si scrhs quod donum ·

is Heaut. ΙΙΙ. ιιι 38, S. Pessuma haec est ιιιιιιιιζι. C. lta vr'delur.
S. Into sisoius. Vah! vide quod r'nceplet sortitus, ‘nay, (it would be
