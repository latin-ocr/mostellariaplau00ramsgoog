LIGE, n. 1306 3 PELLIGE, ιι. 10073 SVTRAGIVM [11, 12],
SVFRAGIO [la 20]; SVBFRAGIA, ιι. 1⁴9²· We find in in·
scriptious ADSIENT, ADFVERIT, ADFVERINT, but there is a
line in Plautus, Poeu. 1. ii. 67, Aa Milphio, teus! Milphio, ubi erl
M. Assum apud le, acum! A. Ego elt'scm sis uolo: where the pun
would be destroyed if we were to read Adsum instead of Assum.

There is a remarkable softening of the preposition ad into ar, of
which we have a few examples: thus ARFVISE, ARF(uerunt),
ARVORSVM, all in 10, and ARVORSARIO three times in 12.

Genemlly speaking, therefore, in printing the text of Plautus it wssl
be safe to retain the prepositions in composition uncbanged, except
in such cases as aca‘pr'o, where our authorities are all opposed to the
harder form.

Doublritg os Semruowea and Mutet.

That the earliest Latin writers did not double the semivowels is
asserted by Quintilian, l. 0. l. vii. ιι, “ Semivocales non geminare
diu fuit usitatissimi moris,” words which however do not necessarily
imply that they never doubled them. The same statement is made
more broadly by Festus and his abbreviator Paulus and they in
several passages extend it to consonants in general, e. g. Fest. s. v.
solitaurilia, p. 293, ed. Muli, “quod si a sollo et tauris¹ earum
hostiarum ductum est nomen antiquae consuetudinis, per unum L
enuntiari non est mirum, quia nulla tunc geminabatur litera in scri·
bendo; quam consuetudinem Ennius mutavisse fertur, ut pote Graecus
Graeco more usus, quod illi aeque scribentes ac legentes duplicabant
mutas semi (anaks e! liquiim);” and again, s. v. porigam, p. 218,
“ Porz‘gom dixisse antiqui videntur pro porrigam propter morem non
ingeminandarum literarum;” s. v. polet, p. 205, “Palen pollet, quia
nondum geminabant antiqui consonantes.” So also s. v. lorum, p. 355,
and Paul. Diac. s. vv. auur, p. 6; ob aloes, p. 19; aulas, p. a 3.

We have already had occasion to advert to the contradictione and .
confusion which prevail among the later grammarians upon this
subject, and therefore we need not now examine their discussions.

Our most ancient inscriptions fully bear out the statement of
Quintilian, provided we admit that the words maianisrmr'moris denote
that the practice, although general, was not invariable. Thus inl
we have PARISVMA; in 2 we have AVLLA and HISPALLI, but
the date of this is by no means certain; in 4, GESISTEI, LlCV·
(l)SET, SVPERASES, but in the same inscription ESSENT and
