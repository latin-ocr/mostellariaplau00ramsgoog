Tabernomlum. This word appears twice in the syncopated form,

tabernaclo, in Amph. 1. l. 270, ²⁷¹ (Troch. Tetr. Can),
In tabmach, td quidm hodie mquam poten] aime,
md-
Quid in tabernaclo fictir-li? Victus m n* dixerim

ln the second of these lines quid in must be proncmnced u one
long syllable, but neither os them decide the quantity of the firnt
syllable in tabernac-uh, which does not, u far as 1 knowy οοσιιι- in
nny ol the poete of the August-an nge. Taberna is found in sevenl
passages in Plan-m, but not one of these decides the quantity or the
first syllable, which is however unquestiombly short in the Augustan
poeta. Terence ufforde no emplel Bnt in Trim ΠΙ. ii. 100
(Troch. Tetr. Can), we find—

Cam'dm in capul, dormibo placide in tabernaculo,

and this is the reading os nu the MSS. Now this line, u it nands,
munet be scanned nnlees npon the supposition dut tabernaculo han
the first long. Hermann proposes to subetimte contuberm'o, while
R. changes plac-liic into fluidak, and thu: sea-ns 3⁸ ΙᾰὸἔνηΙαάἱΙΙο.
We mun therefore either adhere ιο the MSS. and suppose that
tabernaculum has the first long; or, ndopt contuberm‘o, u proposed
hy Herm ‚- or else adopt the conj. emend„ plac-iduh¹ md suppose
that tabernaculo has the second short. Few viu haime to conclude
that whatever the difficulties of the cue my be, the remedy pmpmed
by R. i· much more violent uum the direne, und tlut therefore we
have no evidence whatever os u violation os tlte Rnle os Pontion in
this mse.

Taberna occurs six timeo in Plautus. In five os these passages
stne first syllable may be long or short without affecting the verse.

seem to be required. 1 cannot however man it comsonably n such,

bnt both the text and the srrnngement os lines are very uncertain,
