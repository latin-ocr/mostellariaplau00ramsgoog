EXCVRSVS XIV.'-TALENTVM,'MINA, lec. 243

the Latin dramatists,* and also Talentum magnum argentr‘,† proved sor
a considerable period a source os embarrassmcnt to scholars until
Gronovius (De pecun. vet) demonstrated that these terms, like the
simple Talentum or Tannnn argenti, denoted the ordinary Attio
Talent,‡ and that the epithet magnum was occasionally employed by
the Roman writers, for hy thern only is it used, because they first
became acquainted with the word Talentum in their intercourse
with the Greeks ol Sicily andos some cities of Magna Graecia,
who, like the old Italians, had adopted copper as the standard ol
their currency, and whose money Talent was therefore a Talent
of copper, and equivalent to a very small sur'n. Hence when the
Romans, at a subsequent period, first became acquainted with the
Attic Talent, they would naturally seek to distinguish it irorn the
small Sicilian talent by attaching to it the epithet magrmm.§

ln like manner as Talentum and Talentum argenti are used indit-
serently, so are lllr'rrae ΙΙ and Argenti manueli and likewise Dracltmae
and Brachmae argenti s. argenteae.** When in one passage, Truc.
V. 8, we read, Ego, mea uoluptas, si qnid peccant prens, Subple‘ctiem ad
te hanc menam sero auri, we must understand mnsam auri to signily
not ‘apound of gold' but ‘the value oi a Mina, or pound 'of silver,
in gold!

We have said that wherever mention is made of Greek money in
the Latin dramatists we must refer it to the Attic standard. To this
there is one exception, where however the distinction is carelully
marked, Trin. 11. iv. 23, Trapest'tae mille drachumarnm Olumpr'cnm,
Quas de ratione deln'bur'str', redditae. What these Olympio Drachmas
may have been we cannot tell, sor, as lar as Ι am aware, they are
not named in any other passage in the Classics

tlt will be seen, by referring to Rud. V.' ri. 43, 45, 57, V. rii 19, 24,
that Talentum, ‘lalenlnm magnum, Talentum argenti magam designate the
semesum.

has been controverted, but Ι believe that tt rs generall acce· ed by the
