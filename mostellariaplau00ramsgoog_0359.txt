so in English ‘as' and ‘when' are frequently convertible-we may
say, ‘he came as Ι was at diuner’ or ‘when Ι was at dinner,' ‘1 saw
him as Iwas sitting in a shop’ or ‘when Iwas sitting :' so Merc.
Prol. 99, Diseubr‘lum noctu ut rmus, ecce ad me amomi, i. e. ‘as we
were going to bed‚’ or ‘when we’ &c.; As. 11. ii. 76, Verum in
tonstrina ut sedebam, me unfit percontarier, te. ‘as lwas sitting,' or
‘when I was sitting! Vr semel signities ‘as soon ast' Truc. 1. ii. 6,
Vr semel ammaon ad scorta congerrones.

Venio a perfect tense must often be rendered as if it were
postquam, as in the following examples: Most. 1. iii. 63, Eundem
amomum oporiet nune mihi esse graium ut impetravi, Atque olim, proies·
quam, ie. postquam rmpelraui; Capt. 111. i. 18, Nam u! dudum tin
abri', adcessi ad adulescentes in soro,· Meu. IV. ii. ιι, Quen ut ᾰιιᾰιιιιι
divorti aps ie, redeo nune dmum domum,· Epid. 1v. i'u 30, Quid egoi
qui illam ut prr'rnum orde, numquam ordi postro; Most. 1. iii. 111, Vr
speculum tenuisti, neruo ne oleant argentum manus. We may compare
the well-known line in Virgil, Ecl.V111.41, Vr ιιίᾰι, ιιι perii, ut me
nuru abstuli! error!

Vt followed by quemquo signifies ‘when’ in the sense of ‘as soon
asi As. 1. iii. 93, Supplr'cabo, exopsecrabo, ut quemque ananum m'dero;
Men. 111. ii. 56, Quid froc negoti est? Satin ui quemque conspicor, Ira
me ludificant? ⁸

11. Vr signifying ‘that’

1. Vr, ‘that' is occasionally used in what we may term a
rhetorical question, that is, a question not put for the sake of
obtaining information, but as a mode of expressiug the indignation,
soom, contempt, or ridicule entertained by the speaker for some
statement or opinion expressed by another. In all such cases there
is an aposiopesis before ut, and the blank must be mentally sup·
plied: thus Truc. ll. iv. 87, Egone illam ut non onum! egone elliu!
non bene uelem! ¹(is it possible) that 1 should not love heri (is it
possible to believe) that 1 should not nish her welli' IV. ii. 28,
D. Illinc ut anemuri mei Bona rsiic comedoni) Mortuum, hercle, me

quam ut id palear mavelim, ι(ἰε it to be endured) that those my
enemies should eat up in that house my good thingsi' Trin.111.iii

ιι, Vr ego nunc adulescenti thesaurum rnde'cem Indomita, pleno amoris
ac lasciuiae) Μιιιιιιιιι, minume hercle uero, ‘(whatl do you advise)
that 1 should reveal the hoard,' &c.; Men. IV. iii. 9, ΜιἸιι· ut lu “
dederis pollam ef spinther? Numquam sactum reperies, ‘(what, have
you the assurance to assert) 'that you gave me a shawl and a
bucklei' Pers. 1. iii. 51, T. Hic leno neque le nomineque gnaim
