lviii PROLEGOMENA.

According to what we have said above, the scheme of the Troch.
Tetr. Cat. will be as follows :-

-υ -υ -υ -υ -υ -υ -υ ῦ
υυυ υυυ υυυ υυυ υυυ υυυ υυυ
nn ι.- --ι --ι ἰι- --

υυ -μυ -υυ -υυ -υυ -υυ

Bacchthc Verses.

It is doubtful whether Bacchiae Verses were ever employed by the
Greeks, for the few examples quoted are all susceptible of a different
mode of scansion. They are common in the fragments of the Latin
dramatists, and specimens are to be found in most of the plays of
Plautus.

The species which occurs most frequently is the Bacchiae Tetra·
meter Acatalectic‚ which is found sometimes in a system, sometimes
combined with other species, and sometimes interspersed among
verses belonging to other classes, especially Cretics. Bacchiae
Tetrameters Catalectic‚ Trimeters Acat. and Cat, and also Dimeters‚
are met with occasionally, bnt they are comparatively rare.

The proper foot is, as the name implies‚ the Bacchius (υ - -), and
the following is a pure Tetrameter :-

Sibi quisque ruri metit sr' male emptae.

The Molossus (- - -) is used freely, and is admissible in every
place, frequently in the rst and 3rd, less frequently in the and

- ·and4th.

In rst,
Quid nunc, vise, specle, tuo usque orbriratu.
In and,
Recordare multum et dria cogr'tooe'.
In 3rd,
Ego esse autumo quando aicta audietis.

In ist and 3rd‚
Quando bic nitus est, ei resurgentem dream.
ln and and 4th, -

Srinul gnaruris vos volo esse hunc reim micum.

ln rst, and, and 4th, in Amph. 11. ii. 22,
Furti (itque difirmrifo: id modo sr' mercedis.
