METRE ΛΝΒ PROSODY. lxxxix

Plumppus, and others, must be considered to afford instanoes os the
viohtion os that mle. We shall examine in detail the most remark-
able os these exarnples, and show how iusuffieient is the evidence
they afford to support the theory um has been built upon them.

The word pm'mmata ocem twice:

ι. ln Stich. 11. ii. 54, upon which nothing cm be founded, for
the MSS„ including the Pnlimpsaest, are in the greatest confusion.
The Vulgate, which is due ιο Camensim,

nm Babulom‘ca peristromata, consu-‘aque tapetia,
may be readily scanned as ι Troch Teu. Cat. without doing violeuoe
ῑο the obvious quantity ol' peristromata. Weise has—

Tum Babulonfca pcri'stromata, conduma tapetia,
which may also be scanned ns ι Troch. Tetr. Cat. by pronouneing
mchygvfita. Ritschl has—-

Tum Bafflmza merlromadia tonclyliata tapen'a,
which is less phusible than either os the preceding.

a. The second example is in Pseud. L ii. 13,
Vl ne perixlronala quidem aeque pitia rint Camm'm.

Here the MSS. present no imponant aristion, und the Vulgum,
W.¹ and R. acquiesce in the same remding. Editors have regurded
this as a Troch. Teu. Cur„ in which ease it is impossible to scu it
without consider-ing thal. «he three first syllables of peristromata form

an Anapum im ιιιε line my be scanned without difficulty and ·

without violating the ordimry rules os quantity ns an lambit Tetra-
meler Acalakclic, and it minet be objected that an lambit: verse is
here intruded into a series ol* Trochzscs, for the measure in thia
passage changes iu almost every line, md lambit Ten-ameum
immediately follow the verse in question According to the muge-
ment os W„ we have from the eommeneement of the scene-—

v. 1-5. Tetr⁴ Spondinci Aean

6, Dimeter Creticus.

⁷·9- Cretici Teum.

ιο. lamb. Tetr. Hyper-m

ι ι, 1²⁴ Troch. Tetr- Atat.

13, 14. Troch. Tetr. Cati

15-29. Temni. lamb. purtim Aen. partim Cat. partim Hyper-cat-

There is nothing therefore sunling or unmtural in supposing that
ν. ις is u· lamb. Teu. Aeni. instead of Troch. Tetr. Cat.
