charmel which receives the rain as it drops from the tiles, and carries
it from the roos ina single stream. Such seems to be the explana·
tion os Isidorus XIX. ro and os Pliny H. N. XXXV. ra, ξ 43, who,
when recounting the inventions of Dibutades os Sicyon, says,primusque
personas ugularum extremis imbricibus imposuit, although his words
are by no means clear. Imbrex occurs again in connection with
tegulae in Mil. II. vi. 24, Quod meas corffregisti imbrices et tegulas,· and
in Sisenna Histor. ΙΙΙ., dssrpatis imbricum fragminibus ae testis tegu-
larum, quoted by Non. p. 125, s. v. imbrices ae tegulas. From the
curved form of the imbrex it is used by Virgil in connection with an
arched rool (imbrice tecti, G. lV. 296); in Martial Epp. II. xxxvii. a
it denotes some portion ol a pig, Mammas suminis imbricemque porci,
but what portion we cannot tell ; while from the sound of water
rushing through a narrow channe} it was applied to one os the forms
of theatrical applause executed by bodies of men trained ior the
purpose (bombos et imbrices et testas uocabant), perhaps something
like our Kentisb fire. See the very curious passage in Sueton.
Ner. 20.

26. Nesatt] Observe that ne was the original form os the Latin
negative. Compare ne parcunt=non parcunt, ne quedem, nedum, and
such words as neglego, negotium, necopinatum ·

27. Perpluont Tigna] The verb perpluo is used by Plautus in
two ways, transitivoly and intransitively. Here it is used intransitively:
perpluont ts‘gna, ‘the beams let in the water,’ i. e. ‘the water makes
its way into the beams’ In iii. 8 we have it in the transitive sense:
Haec illa est tempesias mea, mibi quae modalium omnem Detexit tectus
qua sui quam mibi Amor et Cupido In pectus perpluit meeum, i. e.
‘rained through into my heart ;’ and in Trin. ΙΙ. ii. 41, Benesaeta bene-
factis aliis perlegite ue perpluant, i. e. intransitively, ‘lest they let the
water through! Perpluit is generally used impersonally, ‘to let rain
or liquid in through a crevice ;’ but see Most. IV. i. 16, Malum quom
inpluit ceteros, non impluat milti, and observo the change of construction.
For other examples of the use os perpluere see Fest. p. 250, ed. M,
“Poteram perplovere in sacris quum dicerent, significabant pertusam
esse,'' i. e. ‘leaks, lets out the liquid,' where we see the ancient form
plano, whence pluvius (cf. fluo-fluuius); Cato R. R. 155, In uilla cum
pluet, circumire oportet, sicubi perpluat, et 'signare carbone, cum desseret
pluere, uti tegula mutetur, i. e. ‘water makes its way in.’ Quint. VL
ii. t ⁶4 relates awitticism os Galba, who, when a person asked the
loan ol a cloak, replied, “Non possum commodare, demi ntaneo,'' and
then Quint. adds the explanation, curn cenaculum eim perplueret‚
