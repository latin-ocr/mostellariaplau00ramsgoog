It must not be supposed that these various forms oi torture were
by any means confined to male slaves, sor women also seem to have
been treated by brutal masters with the same merciless severity.
This will appear from the terms in which Callicles addresses his
ancillae in Truc. IV. iii. r seqq.‚ and the cruelty os Roman ladies
to their attendants has been forcibly depicted by Juvenal in his sixth
Satire. There is a eurious passage in Terence, Adel. V. iii. 60, where
Demea declares that he will carry off to the country the beautiful
Psaltria, who had fascinated his son, and compel her to perform the
labours os a rustic drudge: M. Modo facito ut illam semer. D. Ego
istuc videro : Atque illi favillae plena, sumt] ac pollrm's, Coquendo sit
saxo et molendo: praeter haec Meridie ipso sacmm ut subdam conligat:
Τ am excoctam reddam atque utrumquem cardo est,· cs. Merc. 11. iii. 78.

Although tortured in a vast variety os ways, slaves were rarely put
to death by their masters, because such vengeance would have
entailed the loss of valuable property. Crucifixion however is sre-
queutly spoken of, and is used as a threat, or a taunt, or a jest:
Most. V. ii. ra (iii. ra), Non em'm itis: ego ferare saxo, ut nurumti,
in crucem· Andr. Ill. v. 15, P. An non disci hoc esse futurum?
D. Dixti. P. Quid merituri D. Crucem ,· Mil. H. iv. 19, Noti
minitari: scio crucem futuram mihi sepulcrum, Idi mei marbres sunt
st‘ti: pater, avos, proavos, abavus, Non possunt miii menania tut's hioe
oculi fodiri.

ln Mil. 11. mo there is an allusion to the practice oi making
the criminal carry the eross or gibbet to which he was to be nailed
through the streets to the spot outside the walls where the execution
took place: Credo ego istm exemplo tibi erse eundum actutum extra
portam,† Dispessismam'dus putidulum quom trudeim· on which a frag·¹
ment from the lost play os the Carbonariass serves as a commentary,
Patibulumfirat per urbem derude adfigat(ur) cruci.

* We talk oi a croso (bar), the Romans called it an owl. The jota in

§eleget refetrss to the practice of boys keeping sparrows, owls, and other
rr as pe .

† We are told that this gate was called the Porta Metia on the authority

οῖ’ Cas. 11. viat Crn Face, Chaline, me certiorem, quid meter vir me mlta ·
· Cu. tlte edepol videre ardentm te extra portam Metiam ; and Pseud. 1. iii. 97,

lam hic ero: verum extra portam Metiam currendum est prius,· but in both
passages the word Metiam is totally destitute of MS. authority.
