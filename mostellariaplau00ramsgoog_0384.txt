EXCVRSVS XV.-SLA VE PUNISHMENTS. 251

Before quitting this subject we may advert to the circumstance
that a great deal ol bad money was in circulation, and hence, when
asum was pald, not only was it customary to assure the receiver
that the eoin was good, but it was submitted to some skilled person
in order that it might be scrutinized and tested ; thus Pers. 111. iii. 32,
Numi sexcenti lu'c erunt Probi numerali, sac st't mulier libera, Atque
leuc centenno adduce. D. Iam saxa hic erit, Non, hercle, cui nune hoc
dem spectandum, sce'o,· and again, IV. vi. 1, Prolati lee'c argenti sunl
sexaginta menae.

That largeries were common we might infer from the number of
counterleits, many ol them executed with great ingenuity, which are
preserved in the cabinets ol collectors. There are the numi plumbei
ol Plautus; thus Cas. 11. iii. 40, Cui hnmani hodie peculi numus nou
es! plumbeus, ‘a lellow whose savings do not amount to a bad
shilling;' so also Most. lV. ii. 12 (i. 33), Tace sis, saber, qui cudere
sales plumbeos Numos,· and Trin. IV. ii. 120, u'ne aurum crederem, Cue',
si capitas res sr'el, nantum numquam credam pluntbeum) ‘is it likely that
I would trust that lellow with gold, whom, were his all at stake, I
would never trust with a bad shillingl'

xv-PUNISHMENT S INFLICTED UPON SLA VES.

Since the trichs and deceptions which so often form the staple
of the New Comedy are for the most part contrived and executed
by cunning slaves, and since their own masters are not seldom
represented as the victims ol these frauds, it is not surprising that
the worhs ol the dramatists should abound in words and phrases
applied as taunts to those who had pald the penalty ol previous
offences. The expressions employed are curiously varied, by Plautus
especially, and a multitude of terms seem to have been coined lor
the purpose.

The common punishment sor an ordinary offence was the seourge
(flagrum) applied to the naked back (dorem s. dorsum-tergus s. ler-
gum) and shoulders (scapulae), often with such severity as to produce
livid marks, scars, and wheals (ce’catre'ces-offerrununtm, and even to
flay off the skin. The instrument employed was a cat made ol
ropes (restes), or strips os ors-hide (megenum-lora), or bundles ol

rods (megae) in which ehn twigs (ae'rgae ulmeae) generally took the

place ol our own national bireh. k
