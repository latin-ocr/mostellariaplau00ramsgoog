Some plays. mongst which ie the Mustellm'a, have been very
mresully corrected, and by different bznds, in others the corrections
nse few and insignificnnt, in others wanting altogether,

Snch then being the state of the MS. as ι whole, it will be evidently
necessary to describe the portion os the MS. which applies to eaeh
plny sepamtely, ιι the remarks which apply to one portion will
obviously not necessu-ily hold good of nnossier.

The Mostellaria is written upon twelve sheets, of which ten are
complete, eight lines at the beginning os the first being occupied with

complete page contains. as a rule, fifty-two lines, bnt two or three

the rest. The changes in the size of hand may possibly have asisen
srorn blanks having been len when the MS. was first trnnscribed,

These are by many different hands.
