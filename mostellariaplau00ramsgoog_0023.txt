Testament in an exceedingly coarse and illexecuted character. The
MS. in its primitive state contained the whole twenty plays, and was
bound up in “ fasciculi '¹ or “quatemiones,” each fasciculus being
composed of four sheets of parchment laid one above another and
then doubled so as to form eight leaves of parchment (membranae)
and sixteen pages, and these fasciculi were distinguished by numerals
placed at the bottom‚ Just as a printer distinguishes his sheets by
the letters called ‘signatores' The volume, when required fora
second writing, had been taken to pieces, the doubled parchments
had been washed and scraped separately, and when rebound, as
might have been expected, no attention was pald to the original
arrangement. Hence many of the sheets which formed the fasciculi
have altogether disappeared, some have been tom and mutilated, in
others the original writing has been wholly or partially obliterated
by the cleansing process, and in others the same result has been
produced by damp and neglect Thus in avery few instances only
is awhole page legible, more commonly a few lines or portions of
lines, but frequently a few straggling letters only, or mere traces
of letters. Enough however remains to enable us to introduce
many important changes and improvements, and to prove that the
MS, if it had been preserved entire, would have been worthy to rank
with the Vatican Virgil and the Bembine Terence.

But this is not the whole. Although we tallr of certain portione
of the MS. being legible, it must not be understood that what
remains is in all cases legible by ordinary inexperienced scholars.
Notwithstanding the ingenious chemical contrivances which have
been applied for the purpose of reviving the faded characters, these
are in numerous instances so indistinct and evanescent that it is
only by dint of the most laborious and painful efforts, efforts labo·
rious and painful alike to the mind and to the eye, that they can be
decyphered at all. Sometimes the MS, when held in a particular

light, will present glimpses of marks before invisible; from these
marks we must endeavour to restore the letters which they indicate,
and then to combine them into syllables and words. It is manifest
that a process of this nature will often yield different results in

different hands. Consequently some individuals have succeeded, or
believed that they have succeeded, in recovering much that is in-
visible or unintelligible to others, and there is always the danger of
an enthusiastic student being carried away by a zealous fancy, and
then making discoveries which exist in his imagination only.

The Mostellarrb in the original MS. seems to have occupied those
