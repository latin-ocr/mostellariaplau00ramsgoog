xxii PROLEGOMENA.

11. Manuscripts.

The authority of MSS. must be considered inferior to that of
the grammarians. Many of them were written at a late period (the
oldest MSS. of Plautus belong to the tenth century) ; they passed
through the hands of a series of transcribers, many of whom were
ignorant, and many careless ; and so little attention was paid to such
matters, that we repeatedly find the orthography of the same word
varying in the same MS.; and hence notonly particular words but
the forms of particular inflexions present the same variations (e. g. in
the case of plural terminations in is or es). It may indeed be urged
that where we meet with an archaic word in the MSS. of Plautus,
even although that fonn is not uniformly observed, we may conclude
that it is an archaism which has been transmitted from a remote
period and preserved by the hand of the faithful copyist, and ought
therefore at once to be admitted and adopted universally. But this
is by no means a safe principle. Thus, although in the earliest
Palimpsests we find uniformly adulescens and ephtula, we have no
right to infer that this is actually the archaic form, which would
naturally accord more closely with the Greek, but, on the contrary,
may only be the mode of spelling which became fashionable in the
fourth or fifth centurias. Again although we find in the best MSS.
of Plautus the word herus in the great majority of cases written erm
without the aspirate, yet when we remember the variations which
took place in the use of the aspirato at different epochs, itis just
as likely that erus may be a modern as an ancient form. Where
the archaism is undoubted, we lrnow it to be such only from
inscriptions, andin certain cases from the testimony of the gram
marians. We ought therefore in all cases to betalre ourselves at
once to the best evidence, where we have it at our command. 1
conceive that it would be just as reasonable to attempt to establish

the orthography of the English language in the age of Queen
Elizabeth by the aid of the text of Shakespeare, as exhibited in the
edition of Johnson and Malone, as to ascertain the orthography
of the Latin language in the sixth century of the city by the aid of
the existing MSS. of Plautus. In either case the old form would
be preserved here and there, while the great mass would be com-
pletely modemised.
