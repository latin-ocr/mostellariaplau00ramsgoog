134 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA. Ι

perhaps applegreen, in his long catalogue of dresses of different
forms and shades, Epid. 11. ii49, Cumatr'le aul plumate'le, emirum aul
nulium,- agaiu Plautus uses meleha to denote a purae or wallet made
of sheepskin (μῆλον) or badger·skin (meles); Epid. l. i. 20, Sed uli
est is? T. Adveeu'sehrul. E. Vbi e't ergo est? aeie'se' in veiiulo, Aut ιο·
in melina attulisti,· and in another passage meleha is employed for
awine sweetened with honey (pelte), Pseud. II. iv. 51, Quill, si opus
sit, ut dulce promat uhde'alemi ecquid labet? C. Rogas? Murrlu‘nam,
passum, defrutum, melcham, mel qucuieseaadr’. Quin u'n corde ahslruere
quondam coepit thermopolim.

107,118. offuciam. Facu] Fueus, according to Pliny H. N. XIII.
25, lt& is ageneral term for marine shrubs, and he tells us that the
Latio language has no word equivalent to the Greek φῦκος, qwneiam
alga herbarum magis uocabulum intelligitur, lie aulem etl frutex. He
goes on to describe three species growing on the rocks by the sea
shore, one of these a native of Creta* and elsewhere speaks of
it as communicating a very fast red colour to wool. There can be
little doubt that Pliuy, or at least his authorities, intended to indicate
by the word sucus some of the ductorial lichena, of which a con-
siderable number are found upon maritime rocks in the Mediterranean,
and even on our own shores, especially those which yield the red or
purple colours, and form the principal constituents of the dye stuff
known as arcltl. The most celebrated of these is the roccella taire-
lorea, which many modern writers have supposed to be identical with
the πάντων φῦκος of Theophrastus, the φῦκος θαλάσσιον of Dioscorides,
the phycos tlalassrhn or fucus of Pliny. Dioscorides denies tlrat the
paint used by women was made from this plant, and asserta that it
was a root bearing the same name, and hence in our dictionaries we
find it frequently stated that sucus means the anellum tractoria or
alkanet root. A German botanist (Endlicher) has recently maintaIned
that the sucus of the ancient was obtained from one of the algae,
the rytrplrlaea tractoria, from which a red colour can be extracted.†
Hence the word sucus is used to signify generally a dye or pigment,
chiefly red, from whatever source obta'rned, as in the passage before

* And yet ln XXXII. ⁶, ς aa, he terms this very plant an alga-Lauda·
te'ssima (alga maris, sc.) quae ia Creta insula iueta terram in petris nascitur,
effugiendis etiam lanis ita colorem adligatis, ut elui pastea non passim· and in
XXVI. 10,§ 66, he mentions the medicinal properties of the same planta, ”
which he comprehends under the name of phycos thalassiae id est suem
marinas, describing the three varietles and alluding to Crete as the habitat
of that used ln dyeing.
