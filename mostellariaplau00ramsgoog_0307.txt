p. 77, presents the words under the form of beto: ‘⁶ Betere, id est,
ire:” and quotes from Varro, muta'eremfirrar batere a'ussr't; and from
Pacuvius, εἰ z'rc curor, prolatet beroe. There is a second quotation
frorn Pacuvius but it is so corrupt as not to be available. Etymo·
logists would connect leto or beto with βῆμι βαίνω, etc.

37. Nescis quam meta'culosa res sr't r're ad riadr'cem.] tlfete‘culosus,
‘full of fear,’ from matus. The word is found again in Amph. 1. i.
137, Nullus est hoc meta'culosus aeque,· and reappears in the writings
of Apuleius Florid. 1. a, §a Observe thatin the Most. the word
signifies ‘causing fear,' in the Amph. ‘feeling fear,' in Apuleius it
is applied as an epithet of the hare (leporem meticulosum).

V. iii. 1. Vbi somnum sepelivi omnem atque obdormivi crapulam]
Crapula, which is identical with the Greek minabo, signifies properly
the headache and nausea which follow a drunken debauch. Plautus
employs it again in Pseud. V. i. 35 and in Rud. II. vii. 28: in the
latter passage we read, Qua'rr abeo hr‘rrc in Veneris sanum, at edormircam
lranc crapulam, whence many edd. substitute cdormrirr‘ for obdormivi in
our text. Crapula is found also in Cicero, Livy, and Pliny. The
adjective crapularr‘us appears in Stich. Ι. iii. 74, Vel unctiones Graecas
sudatorias Vendo, uel altas malacus crapularras:* crapulantur and
u crapulosus occur in late writers only.
⁸ t 9. De cenasacio gratiam] i.e. ‘thank you, excuse rne' This was
the formula when a person wished politely to decline an invitation,
and is exactly represented by the French je oour remera'e and the
Italian grazia, which, when used in reply to an offer or invitation,
always signify ‘no, 1 thank you.¹ The phrase is varied in Men, 11.
iii. 3⁶, E. Eamus intro, ut prandeamus. M. Bene vocas: taor gratia
ert, i. e. ⁴ you are very kind’-‘(l must decline, bnt) 1 arn obliged to
you all the same 3’ and so again in Stich. III. ii. 17, Cenabis apud me,
quomam salros advenis. E. Vocula est opera nuncqur'derrr: tarn gratia
est, ‘I arn engaged, but l arn obliged to you all the same ς’ in Trin.
II. ii. 14, Hi mores marorum laudant, Eosdem Intulerat, quor collaudant,
larice ego te ,artibus gratiam Facio, neu colar, neu r'rrrbuar lugarium .·
i. e. ‘from following such practices Ι excuse you!

²3· enirn aitr'c captro est] Enim here indicates an aposiopesis.
We must supply, ‘no‚ I thank you, forthere is fraud in that pro-

posal of yours.’ The same words occur in the same sense in Epid. -

V. ii. 36. For the word Captr'o see note on IV. ii. 19.

* This at least is the reading of the Ambrosian Palimpsest. BCD have
vel alias mala castra pullarios.
