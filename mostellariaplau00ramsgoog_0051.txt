in which it was eventually superseded by e. Among these we find
Tortores lor Tenores, Quintil. 1. v. ²²3 Amplocn' for Amplectr', Prisc.
p. 552, Cassiodor. p. 2283. The latter gives Amplectere, Vertere,
Advorsum, and Convellere, Velare ior Convellere, Velare. Charis. p. 174,
gives Voturios ior Veturros, and this reoeives some support froin the
inscriptions, nn. 1029, 1057, 1082, in which the letters VOT. are usually
interpreted to refer to the Tribus Veturio Veniam lor Veniam is
quoted from Plaut.As.1V. i. ⁴4 by Nonius, p. 45; Volz'ni lor Veleia,
Pn'sc. p. 848.

Judging from the examples preserved, the form andus instead ol
endur was general in gerundives os the third and fourth conjugatione
nntil towards the close os the Republic. Thus we find DE-
FERVNDO, DEICVNDO, FACIVNDVM bis, LEGVNDEIS,
LEGVNDIS, QVAERVNDAI, SCRIBVNDI [12], VENDVN-
DEIS [14 biiJ, LEGVNDEIS [16 ὂίε] REFERVNDVM [17],
CAPIVNDEIS [18 ter]‚ DEIVIDVNDA lis, ERCEISCVNDA
bis [19], REFERVNDVM sexies, REFICIVNDVM, FACIVN·
DVM [20]; SAEPIVNDVM, n. 14193 VENIVNDVM, n. 1431,
and so in many other inscriptions, which may be fairly rechoned as
falling within the above limit.

This sorm however did not prevail to the exclusion of that in endas,

for we lind FACIENDAM, EXDEICENDVM, as early as 10, and
COLENDI [18]. Observe also that mdus is employed uniformly
in those verbs where the use os the termination undere would have
involved the introduction ol uu: thus TRIBVENDEI [12],
FRVENDVS, FRVENDVM, FRVENDA quinquies, FRVENDEIS
[14]‚ FRVENDEIS [20].

V iuerat, acciperent, C. primurn Caesaris inscriptione traditur sac·

however confined to optumus, maxumus, but extended to all super-
latives which in later times were written with rhem. Thus PARI-
SVMA [1], PLOIRVME, OPTVMO [8], FACILVMED [10]‚
PROXSVMVS [11 ter]‚ PLVRVMAE, PROXVMVS, PROX·
SVMVS quater [12], PROXVMVS bis, INFVMVM [ιν [13],
