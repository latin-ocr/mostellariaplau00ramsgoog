ego vero quamobrem disarius meseth, ‘why, for that matter, in south,
l do not know why you are doing that.¹

Sometimes the qualification introduced by quin is so strong that it
must be translated ‘nay, on the contrary :' Trin. IV. ii. 87, C. Lubet
audr're, ηίεί molestum est. S. Quin dr'serepio dicere: here quire refers to
the foregoing molestum-‘ (disagreeable l) nay, on the contrary, 1 am
most eager to tell you;' Merc. 1. 43, Egon’ ausim tibi myream qur‘c-
quam sommus salsum proloqui? Quin r'erm priusquam sr‘rn elocutus, sees,
εί mentiri volo, ‘do you think it possible that l would dare to tell
you a salsehood? No, on the contrary, before 1 open my lips, you
know’ &c.; Most. IV. ii. 38 (iii. 15), P. Nam mr'si hr'rrc hodie emi·
μαυίί, aut heri, certo scio Hr'c fabulare. Τ. Quin sex memes riam
fre'c nmmo emetat, ‘why, on the contrary, Ι tell you,' &c.; hlerc. ΙΙ.
ii. 54, L. Ad portum propero: nom ibi milri ngotrum est. D. Bene
anebulato. L. Bene rmleto. D. Bene sit te'br': here Lysimachus quits
the stage and Demipho continues, Quin milei qumque etrum est ad
portum negotium, Nunc adeo ibo illuc: Demipho replies to his own
thoughts as it were, ‘dare any one suppose that 1 am going to remaln
here? No, on the contrary, 1 also have business at the harbour,
and therefore l will now repair thither!

The use of queit in the following passages may, at first sight, cause
some embarrassment, but they may be referred to one or other of
the classes examined above: Stich. 1v. ii. 44, G. Quid gerare
E. Dici equidem ire carcerem ires. G. Quin, russerie, Eo quoque ebo,
‘well then,’ ‘nay, for that matter,' or simply ‘but, if you give the
order, 1 shall go even thither' (to prison); where que'n qualifies eo
quoque ibo. Many editors read εί russerr's, but si is not found in the
best MSS, and is unnecessary‚ in so far as the constmction is con·
cemed, the perfect of the subjunctive being frequently employed to
indicate an hypothesis; thus Iuv. S. III. 77, emmo novel Graeculus
cremeris, r‘n eaelum, iusseris, ibri: Trin. 11. ii. 60, Nem eo hoc delo quere,
quae tu vr's, ego velem etfaciam lubens, ‘1 do not say this for the
purpose of implying that 1 am not willing to accommodate myself
to your wishes, and to do cheerfully what you desire,' where queit is
equivalent to ut nom· Mero. ΙΙ. iii. 93, the father and son are disputing
about Pasicompsa, Demipho says, Viginti mr'rrri. opriror, posse me ellam
vendere. C. Ar ego revelem, rom dantur septem et urgr'rrte' mimae. D. Αί .
ego . . . C. Quin, ego, inquam . . . D. ΑΙ nescii quid dr'cturus sem, tace.-
qur'n here marks an eager interruption-Demipho says, ‘But I (would
give).' C. ‘N0‚ but I, l tell you, (would give more) ;’ IV. iv. 25,
D. Palam r'slaee fiunt, te me mese. L. Quin nego, ‘n0,n0,1deny
