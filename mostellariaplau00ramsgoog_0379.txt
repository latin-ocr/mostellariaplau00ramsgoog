246 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

111. Numus s. Numus argenti. It will be seen from the examples
quoted above that the word Numur is occasionally used with re·
serence to the Philippus, but in this case the adjective aureius (or
Philippeus) is usually combined with it, and where these are omitted,
as in Bac. lv. iv. 55, 58, viii. 27, 32, ix. 110, Poen. ΙΙΙ. 11. 17, Trim·
IV. ii. 128, 161, 1119 context is such as to leave no doubt that the
Philippus is meant,

But there are several passages in Plautus in which numus cannot
mean the numur aureus or Philippus, indeed the designation numus
argenti is by no means uncommon, e g. As. 11. rv. 80 ,‘argentr numum
Aul Ι.“ n 3ο, argenti numos: ci. n. 343 Pseud. Ι. 195, numus argenta
iii. 65, πωπωπ argenti.

In such cases it is difficult to discover what sum is indicated.
Moreover doubts have arisen whether the same sum or coin is
uniformly indicated by Numus, and also whether the word is em·
ployed with relerence to Greek or to Roman currency.

1. It is used ior money in general, or pieces oi money, without
special reference to any particular sum or coin: thus Bac. IV. iv. 17,
Num qui numi exciderunt, here, tihi, quad *sic terram Optuerel ‘you
have not dropped some pieces of money, master, have youl' and so
As. 11. iv. 34, adducit (sc. trapezitam) domum etiam alienet scribit
numos, ‘draws a bill upon him!

2. Numus or Numus argentiis used to denote a trifling sum:
thus Capt. ΙΙ. 11. 82, Eum si reddis mihi, praeterea unum numum ne
dun, ‘il you restore to me my son, do not give me a single shilling
in addition (lor your ransom). In Pers. IV. iv. 111 πωπω abesse heire
nun polest means, ‘I won't take a shilling less ;’ just as we had above
quoted lrom Rud. V. ii. 43, nan potest trebholum hinc abessa· so also ⁸
in Most. 1. ii. 34 (31), siquid numa sarciri potest, ‘if any desect can
be repaired for a trifle3’ cf. Pseud. 1. i. 79, iii. 122, v. 91, 11. ii 49,
V. ii. 24 ; 111 Epid. V. ii. 35, where the slave offers to take heavy
odds, he says, ni ergo matris filia est, In nuum numum, in tuum
talentum, pignus da, ‘I bet you a numus to a taient ;' and so 111. i.9.

3. But there can be no doubt that Numus is frequently used to
indicate a piece ol money of definite value: thus in Epid. Ι. 1. 52
Stratippocles is represented as having borrowed a sum of money

at Thebes lrom an usurer, lor which he was to pay at the rate os ᾖ

a numus per day for each mium· in Men. 11. ii. 16, 37, a numus is
named as the price oi a young pig fit for sacrifice (porci sacres
sinceri); in Epid. 111. 11. 36 Epidicus proposes to hire the services
os a fidicina lor a πωπω] in Pers. IV. vi. 2, when asummf sixty-
