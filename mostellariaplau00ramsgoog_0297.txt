164 PLAVTI MosTELLARIn

from this play, the following will serve to illustrate the origin os these
phrases and the manner in which they are used: Capt. ΙΙΙ. iv. rao,
San'n me illi hodie scelesti capti ceperunt dala, where there is a sort oi
pun on capti (prisoners) and ceperunt ,· so Bac. V. ii. 88, Lepide ipsi
hr' ssent capti, sues qui filie's secere rnsideiar: e'te,· and Pseudo IV. iii. 11,
Metuo aanor, ne hores redeat etiarn dura a soro, Ne capta prae& capti
praedones suanl,· Epid. ΙΙΙ. ii. a 3, nn ipse cautor coprus est. Capto
signifies ‘to lie in wait ior;' Amph. l. i. 266, Quid ene captas, car·
nusex? i. e. ‘why are you trying to catch me by your questionsl’
ΙΙ. ii. 163, Me captas, ‘ you are trying to ensnare me ;’ andin a. 189,
capto is distinguished from capia, T u si ene r‘enpnde'cr'teiae captas, non
potes capere, i.e. ‘is you are endeavouring to lead me into a snare,
and convict me of unchastity, you are not able to entrap me ;' arrd
in Epid. ll. ii. 31, eos captabant signifies ‘they were watching to
ensnare them 3' in a. 112, Verum,s1'plus dederes, reseram: nehil in ea
re capno est. So captio est, Truc. ΙΙ. vii. 65, ‘that is not iair3’ and
Aa. IV. i. 45, captr'oeees meteri, ‘you are afraid oi having tricks
played off upon you!

²7· Nunc ego me illac per postem ad congerrones conseram] There
seems to be no doubt that the word congerrones signifies ‘ jolly com·
panions,’ ‘metes' or something equivalent lt occurs again below,
V. i. 8, Capro consilinm ul sennem congerronum convocem ,· and in
Pers. 1. iii. 9, Iane pol ille hic aderit, credo, congerro meur. Nom, p. r 18,
quotes the line from the Persa and explains it, ‘ut conlusor meus qui
easdem exerceat nugas! Gerra is found in Heaut. V. iv. 10, gerra,
iners, fraus, helluo Ganeo, damnosus. Observe also the word gerres
denoting ‘sprats' or some small, worthless fish. The etymology
is altogether uncertain. Varro, L. L. Vll. 55, who also quotes this
line, says, “Congerro a gerra et Graecum est, et in Latina cratis.”
The Greek form with which we are acquainted is γέρῤον, and signifies
‘anything made oi wicker-work,' thus answering closely to crater, but
the connection with congerro is by no means obvious. Gerroe is used
several times by Plautus in the sense os ‘stuli and nonsense,' ‘bosh‚’
‘trash ;' e. g. Poen. l. i. 8, Narn tuae blanditias mihi nent, qaod deii
solet, Gerrae germanae, alque edepol λῆροι lipom and so gerrae max·
urnae, in Epid. 11. ii. 49: frequently it is simply an exclamation, as in
Trin. Ill. iii. 31, and As. 111. iii. ro. The word reappears in Ausonius,
in the preiace addressed to Symmachus, prefixed to Eidyll. XI.
Misi a'taque ad te frivola gerris Siculis vaniora, where by the epithet

Siculis he evidently alludes to the ioolish story told in Paul. Diac.
(sv. Gerrae, p. 94, ed. Mul.) to explain how gerrae, supposing it to
