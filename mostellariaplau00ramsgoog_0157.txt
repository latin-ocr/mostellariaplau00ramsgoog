ln the following Scene, more than the usual amount of confusion existo
in the different MSS. and edd. in regard to the distribution of the dialogue
among the characters. We have, for the most part, adhered to the
Vulgate. Hermann, Ritschl, and Weise, differ as to the metrical consti-
tution of the passage, and each introduces changes in order to suit his
own views. We have closely followed the division into lines found in B,
except ln one instance, and have adhered to the text ofthat MS, except
where itwasobviously corrupt. “

r. venire, so the MSS. veniri RW and others. The i in ναῖκι

4. me ibi male CDFZ. ibi is omitted in B, being written above byc
or a late hand. raesum est, so Pareus. rerunt D. ln B there isa
sort of dash or stroke at the end of the word, so, firmi} it is probably
intended for serum. ln iv. 1. 17 (873) the m is written in exactly the
same way, where R reads sum-sunt seems better. te runt C. cerunt Fz.
