Hoc motu radiantis Etesiae in uada poem*

There is no controversy that, in solatas the text oi Plautus and
Terence depends upon MS. authority, there is au immense number
os cases in which elision is altogether neglected, that is, in which the
last syllable of a word ending in a long or in a short vowel, in a

diphthong or in the letter m, is not elided before a word beginning
with a vowel, a diphthong, or the letter h. Weise refers to sixty-six
“indubitata exempla ” in the Amphitruo alone, and every play will
hrrnish alarge number. But notwithstanding this, not a few of the
editors os Plautus, by changing the order of the words, by inserting
or omitting monosyllables and ejaculations, or, when the more simple
means fail, by bad and arbitrary conjectural changes, have con·
sidered themselves entitled‚ at any cost, to soree the verses os Plautus
into accordance with the metrical rules observed by poets whose
compositions are of a character totally different, and who flourished
at a period when the language and the laws os versification had
reached their highest point oi cultivation and stringency. The first
who undertook to satisiy the conditions oi this sels-imposed law was
Pylades, os Brescia, who considered the simple explanation, “metri
causa,” ajustification sor any change he thought fit to introduce
into the text, and many oi his interpolations were adopted by his
successors‚ and long maintained their ground. Others followed in
the same direction until the work oi destruction and reconstruction
seems to have been pushed to its extreme limit by Bothe and Ritschl.

Bentley, while admitting that the licence was frequently resorted
to by Terence, endeavoured to establish a code os rules by which
he supposed it to be defined and limited. These were—‘⁶ ln his

Anapaesti. Harum vero conditionum ignorantia quot nuper peperit
errores? dum et in polysyllabis verbis, et in syllabis brevibus, et in
aliena sede, posse fieri hoc existimabant”

It was soon perceived however by all who took an unprejudiced
view os the subJ'ect that the boundaries here marked out were iar
