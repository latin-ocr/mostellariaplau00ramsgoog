94 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

in Pers. ΙΙ. ii. 11, Scio fidei hercle herili ut soleat samaritae oppro-
brarier, where fida' heroli means ‘honesty oi a slave (i. e, when a slave
is honest) in the service oi his master3’ and the import of the passage

“ is, ‘I know that it is usual sor a slave who is honest in the service os

his master to be twitted with impure motives.' In so lar as the
sentimental the passage is concemed, it is repeated below, IV. i.
3, 5. Weise, who explains “Sensus debet esse: scio heros non
stare solere promissis,'' has entirely mistaken the meaning, which
was correctly apprehended by Acidalius.

4. te. . . ulcsscarprobel We have the same words in Poen.V. iv. 58, ,

Nunc pol ego te alcrimr probe. Vler'scor, in Plautus and Terence, is
generally construed, as here, with the accusative ol the person on
whom vengeance is to be taken* Sometimes we have in the
ablative the kind ol punishment, as Cas. 11. i. &Flagitium r'llud
homsae's! ego allam fame, ego illum sia, maledictis, malefactis, amatorem
Vlciscar: but it is also construed with the accusative os the thing on
account os which vengeance is taken, as in this play, the third line
· from the end, lot utrumque, et hoc et illud, potero alcisci proba· so also
Poen. V. v. 1, St' ego arrham non altus suero probe, quam le'aom' dedi
T ura proficio rae stoi habento scurrae lude'ficatur',· and Trin. V. ii. 49,
Illa'serura est male promerita, ut merila, si etthi ulctsct'noa licet, i. e. ‘It
is very provoking il lam not allowed to inflict upon evil deeds the
punishment they have deserved.' This is the speech ol Charmides
aster he had unwillingly agreed to forgive his son. Weise appears
to have mistaken the meaning when he says, “ Sensus: miserum est
si mihi non licet et filium punire, et amicum remunerare aut gratias

referre ei;’' and he seems to bave had some misgiving, sor he adds, .

“Sed haec sententia aliquanto plus iusto perplexa est.”

5. Exi, taquam, nriior, e calciso] ie. ‘come forth, you stinking
scullion.' The reading is very doubtful, and was probably suggested
to Pylades or some other early corrector by the line in Juvenal S.
V. 162, Captum te nidore suae putat ille culinae, and that in Martial
Ι. xciii. (xcii.) 9, Pasceris et nigrae solo nidore calaaae. lVr'dor properly “
signifies the small, smoke, 'or vapour proceeding from some obiect
when burned, and generally indicates a rank, soetid, or suffocating

* So Amph. IV. iii. 93 As. l. ii. ²23 Cas. ll. iv. ao; Bac. 111. iv. 9, istane ᾖ
ulciscar multis modu, Bac. V. 2, 69; Epid. 11.ii.a4; Men. l. ii. 17, lV. il·
723 Pers. IV. vii. 163 Pseud. V. ii. 26; Rud. 111. iii. 363 Trin.lll.r.18;
As. V. ii. 53, where the accusative of the person is understood, not ex-
pressed: and so And. lll. v. 18; Eun. IV. vi. 243 Hec. 1. i. 15; Phor.
V. vii. 69. harre nostro modo alcisci.
