rhgrotum dr'cri·r‚· Poen. Ι. ii. 90, Bonam ego quom beatam me esse 11111111
dici nrooolo. Into the following also the idea ο1 comparison enters:

11111113· that is, ‘while on the one hand, this circumstance (viz. that my

In Men. V. ii. 69, S. Tu negas. Ma. Nego hercle vcro. Mv. Nonio
hoec sopimur negor: the meaning is clearly ‘these denials are more
shameless by lar thau your previous falsehoods’ More difficult is the

Bacchides: Nicobulus enters saying, mino illaec 111 est magnae
dizviiiize 1111111, Suptersugesse sic mr'lrr' hodie Chrusalum: but we may
regard this as intended to be the continuation ο1 a soliloquy com-
menced by Nicobulus before he appeared on the stage, in which,
alter having mentioned some annoyance‚ he goes on, ‘far more am
1 incensed by the circumstance that Chrysalus,' &c
