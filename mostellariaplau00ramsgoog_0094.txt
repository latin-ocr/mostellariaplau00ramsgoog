Now 1 would earnestly impress upon the young seboin. tim the
belief that we cun employ the knowledge which we possess with regnrd
to the secentumion of latin words iu any way whatsoever ω ns to
‘explain or illustrate questions with regni-d ιο quantity, is an absolute
delusion, znd is moreover a mischievous delusion, because it is not
only erroneous izself but tends to divers us away from a poth which,
stthough inuioete, may possibly be tlireaded, into nn inexuimble
labyrinth of fanciful conjectures. Although from the langmge held
in the pmssge quoted above and adopted by others, we should be
led to suppose that we were handling something real and subm-atini,
n very few words will suffice to show that in following such τοκῆι-σὴς·
we are in reality sti-iving to gasp an airy nothing.

ι. Anything which we know with regnsd ιο the sooentuau'on of
Latin words is derived from the old guaimarium, who sme in
the most specific ter-ms that Accens and Quantity ue perfed-ly
distinct.

π. The mles which they give for the determination of the acoenst
in esch word are founded on the previously ascet-latina φωνῶν os
certain syllables in the word. To determine the position of the
necent therefore from the quantity of certain syunblesy md then to
employ the secent a an instrument for determining the qiunu'ty of
the same, or of other syllables in the nme word, is Μεθυ-
ίΙΙυςίαιιιιάίηι-πγειιειιωυωωιόκὼηςυωεηι

3. Among much confusion snd msny diserepancies our ancient
authorities sre unanimous upon one point, thst the nocent in poly-
syllables cun san only on the penultimae and antepemntimste. But
Lindemann is obliged at the very outset to tbrow this ennon over-
board, and ιο carry back the secent in many words to the fourth
syllable from the end of the word*
