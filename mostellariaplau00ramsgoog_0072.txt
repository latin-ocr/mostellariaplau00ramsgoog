METRE AND PROSODY. lv

especially is comparatively rare in the 5th place, although many
examples may be quoted, as Most 1. i. 23,

parasitos opsonafe pollucibilem·
and III. i. 40,

D. Hic homo est thanis T n. Hic homo certe esf ariolus·

and in 1. i. 69 we have two Dactyls consecutively in the 4th and
5th places. Lines however constantly recur which contain no
Iambus, except in the last place, e. g. Most. Ι. i. 4,

Ego pol fc ruri si veham ulcr'scar probe,

where we have au Anapaest in the rst place, followed by four
Spondees; in v. 18,
Augebth ruri numerum genu' serraliis,

we have Spondees in the rst, and, and 5th‚ and Dactyls in the
3rd and 4th3 in v. 16,

Quare r'n pritrr'num scr's actutum frade'er,

we have five Spondees in succession.

The penthemimeral caesura is preserved with considerable regu-
lurity, although, as might have been expected, it is frequently
neglected.

ste Iambt'c Tetrameter Catalectr'c,

called by the Latin grammarians &smnus and Comicae Quadratus,
was formed, according to the views of Varro, hy the addition of
three syllables to the Iambic Trimeter.*
It consists of seven and a-half feet, and admits the same feet as the
Trimeter, vin, the Iambus, Tribrach, Spondee, Anapaest, and Dactyl.†
There is a division of the verse at the end of the 4th foot,
which thus ought to end with aword, and this rule, although occa·

sionally violated by the Latin writers, is observed by them more .

strictly than by the Greeks.

All the abovenamed feet are admissible in any place of the verse,
but the Spondee and the Anapaest are rarely found in the 4th, and
the Dactyl is still more uncommon. Bentley would exclude both the

⁸ Varro, quoted by Diomedes, p. 514, and by Rufinus, pp. 2706, ²707·

† Bentley and Hermann add to these the Proceleusrnattcus (1.3. voco),
but l believe that all the passages quoted in support of this opinion are
eitheyl manifestly corrupt, or may be scanned so as to get rid of such 33
infru er.
