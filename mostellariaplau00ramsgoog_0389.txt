Cas. 11. viii. 2, Sine mado rus venriet, ega remittam ad te airum Cum
furca in urbem, Tamquam carbonarium, i.e. ‘as black with blows
as if he were a charcoal bumer;'* vi. 37, 0. Taceo, Deos quaeso.
C. Vt quibem tu bode'e canem† et furcam seras. 0. Mibi ut sortitsb

A thies was sometimes branded with the three letters FVR, and
hence was called in derision lateratus or trium literarum boma: Cas.
ΙΙ. vi. 48, C. T u ut liquescas, ipse actutum uirgis calefactabere. S. Hoc
age sis, Olumpia. 0. Si be'c literatus me sinam Aul. 11.iv. 46, Turi
trium literarum bomo Me vituperas) sur, etiam sur trffurcrser.‡

When a slave belonging to the Familia Vrbana had committed

some unpardonable offence, or wras found to be of habits incorrigibly
bad, he was transferred to the Familia Rustica, and was sent to the
country, where he was hardly used, frequently worked in chains, and
was employed in the most severe and distasteful labour. The sort
of toil most frequently referred to is working in the mills where the
corn was husked and ground (pistrinum-mala), and this taslr was

probably generally assigned to refractory town slaves because no
more skill was necessary than is required in turning a modern
tread-mill or prisoncranlr: Most. I. i. 18, Augebis ruri numerum,
genusserratile‚· Andr. I. ii. 28, Verberibus caesum te, Daue, in pistrinum
dedam usque ad necem Ea lege atque amim ut, site inde exemerim, ega

* lt is not impossible that there may be a double meaning here, and
that charcoal burners may have carried their burdens on a frame similar
to what French porters call a fourcbetre.

†Canem seems to be the reading of the MSS, and if it is correct the
meaning must be left to conjecture. Meursius would substitute Camum
(the Greek anabau muzzle or twitch for a horse), which is supposed to
mean a ‘collar’ or ‘chain’ in a passage quoted from Accius by Nonius,

. 200.

Ρ 1 Stigmatias is used to denote abranded slave in Cic. de off. 11. 7, ς 25,
Omiseram, qui fideliorem et barbarum et stigmatiam putaret quam coniugem!
apassage quoted by Nonius (μ). Stigmosus is found in Petronius Arbiter,
, c. 109, and in Plin. Epp. 1. v. quoted from M. Regulus.

' §The expression in mando occurs elsewhere in Plautus, Cas. 111. iii. 3,
