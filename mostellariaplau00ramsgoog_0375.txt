os Alexandria. But in these and in all other places where the same
denominatione were employed,

r Talent = ⁶0 Minae.

r Mina = 100 Drachmae, ἲ

r Drachma = 60bols. ’

Moreover, throughout Greece and her colonies in Asia and Africa,
when money was concemed, aTalent denoted sixty pounds' weight
oi silver* a Mina one pound weight os silver, aud a Drachma
ὠμὴ of apound weight of silver3 hut since the absolute weight os
the Mina varied in different districts, the actual money value os a
Talem, a Mina, and aDrachma varied in like proportion. Os these
three denominatione the Drachma alone was acoin; no piece ol the
weight ol a Talent or even ol a Mina was everminted sor circulation.
The heaviest Greek coin known is a Decadrachm, the most common
are Tetradrachms and Didrachms,† and the Athenians coined silver
pieces as low as a quarter-obol‚ or r¹r¹h ol a Drachma.

In the works ol the Latin dramatists all computatione in Greek
money must be referred to the Attic standard, and wherever mode-
rate sums are named we shall not commit any grave error if we
consider the value ol the

Attic Drachma = 9d. sterling.

- Mina = 2315 o „

— Talent :2225 o o „
and the - Obolus = ¹d ‚,

Since the Athenians employed silver as the standard ol their
currency, wherever we find the words Talentum or Mim in Plautus
or Terence they uniformly denote respectively a sum ol ⁶000 and
and roo Drachmae, the word argenti being sometimes added and
sometimes omitted. Thus when we read in Merc. IV. iii. 4, Hem
quoi decem talenta dont· detuli,· and in Heaut. V. i. 67, Duo talenta
pro re nostra ego esse decrevi ratri, the same Talent is indicated as
when it is said, Phor. V. iii. ⁶, ex leis praediis talenta argenti bina
Statim capiebat; and in Merc. Prol. 88, Τ aientum argenti r'prus sua
adnumerat manu: in the latter passage it is clearly implied that the
value of a Talem was counted out in silver coin 3 and so As. 1. iii 41,
Si mihi dantrrr duo talenta argenti nunterata r'n manum.

* lf this does not hold good universally‚ the exceptions arc not such

as require to be noticed here.
