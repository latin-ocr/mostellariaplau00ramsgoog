111 PROLEGOMENA.

Dr'phthongs.

Considerable uncertainty prevailed in the use of diphthongs.

Originally ai seems to have been used in preference tone. Thus,
GNAIVOD, AIDILIS [1], AIDILES, AIDILIS, AIDE(M) [3],

QVAIRATIS [5]‚ QVAIS(ter) [6], AID. CVR. [7]‚ AEDEM,
AIQVOM‚ TABELAI DATAI (nom.) [10]. So PRAIDAD, n. 63,
643 QVAISTORES, n. 181,185 (also QVEISTORES‚ n. 183);
AIRE, n. 181. So in many proper names, especially in AIMILIVS.

Again, we have or' used for oe: as FOIDERATEI [10]‚ and
FOIDERE [20].

Less frequent is the use of a simple vowel for a diphthong‚ as
PORTVNE, n. ⁶43 FRVDE [12], which may be an accidental
blunder‚ since we bave FRAVDE a few lines lower down in the
same inscription.

EIS for IS in Donnes aad Ablalrbes Plural ty* the
First and Second Declenst'ont.

The practice in this case was similar to what took place in the use
of ei for long i. ln all probability the longer form was universal 11 first,
prevailed 101 a considerable time, and by degrees 1011 altogether into
disuse. It maintained its ground however more firmly and fora
longer period than (ι’. All the examples in the earliest inscriptions
uniforrnly exhibit eis. Thus FACTEI(S) [4]‚ MIEIS [7], EEIS
three times, and VOBEIS [10]‚ PROXSVMEIS [11 ter]‚ ΤΑΒΟ-
LEIS [11 bis]‚ EIS [u]. When we come down to 12 we find the first
indications of uncertainty; although the 01111010101 eis are nume·
rous, we find 1101111111 anu 10111111111111111111111 ann
AESTVMANDIS, LEGVNDEIS and LEGVNDIS, and the com·
bination TABOLEIS PVPLICIS, although TABOLEIS POPLI·
CEIS occurs also. We have three examples of PRIMIS in 12,
in lo three examples of PRIMEIS, and, generally speaking, down to
20, and even later, the form eis will be found greatly to preponderate,
so that we may without scruple employ 11 in the text of Plautus*

will be seen 111 the Preface on what munds 1 bave thought it advisable
to retain the more familiar orthography.-E1>.]
