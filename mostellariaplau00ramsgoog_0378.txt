EXCVRSVS x1v.-TALENTVM,lt!an,ec. 245

were known as Gold Philips, they were up to a recent period to be
found in circulation on the eastern borders of Europe, they are still
frequently discovered in large hoards, and numerous specimens are
to be seen in all collections of ancient Greek medals* They are
mentioned frequently in Plautus,† and must have been a common
medium when the authors of the New Comedy flourished.

We may enumerate the different names by which they are designated.

In the Poenulus we find three hundred spoken of as, Ι. i. 37, aurci
trecenti numi Philippu· 111. iv. 3, aurci trecenti nunti qui uocantur
Philippu· 111. 57, trecentos nuntos Philippu,- Ι. 111. 6, trecentos Plri-
lippos. ln the Bacchides we find two hundred spoken of, IV. viii.
41, ducentos nuntos aurcos Philippos protom 117 ,ducentos Phil lippos

e·ureos, 11114587, 113, ducentos numos Philippos,- viii.27,duccuts

Philipps] cf. o. 38,' rx. 117, and simplyo. 10, ducente nurni,· cf. IV.
iv. 55, 58, viii. 32· In the Trinumus, a thousand, V.'' u. 34, mu'lle
ouri Philippunr; 1115, mr'lle numum aureum ,· 11. IV. ii. 111, where
the reading is doubtful ; see also As. Ι. iii. 1, Trin. 1. 11. 115.

When Agorastocles says, Poen. 1. 11. 131, Sunt nitu intus nescio
quot numi aurei lumpirotici, he means ‘gold Philips struggling to make
their escape‚’ as if they were madmen under restraint.

There is a puzaling passage in Rud. V. ii. 26: Labrax is describing
the contents of the Vidulus; we read in the Vulgate Text, Numi
octingenti aurei in marsupio ensuerunt, Praeterea centurn denaria Plri-
hppca in pasceolo seorsus, but the word denaria is altogether destitute
11 support from any good his, The Vetus Codex of Camerarius
31111, Preterea centum rnna philpprh, which may mean ‘a hundred
Minae in Philips‚’ 11 we suppose that there was a familiar idiom by
which the singular could be substituted for the plural, 11 when we
talk of ‘a hundred pound.'

lt would appear that Philips, in consequence of the ease with
which they could be procured, and the purity of the metui, were
commonly employed as bullion by artificers who executed works in
gold; hence the allusion in Curc. ΙΙΙ. 71, ibi nunc statuam volt dere
auream Solidumfucs'undam ex auro Philippeo.

* They passed into Gaul and from thence to Britain, and the whole of
the early gold coinage 11 these countries“ may be said to consist 11 imi-
tations more 11 less rude and degenerate of the Macedonian Philippusd'·
See the admirable work of Mr. John Evans on the Coins 11 the Ancient
Britons. Lond. 1864, p ²4·
