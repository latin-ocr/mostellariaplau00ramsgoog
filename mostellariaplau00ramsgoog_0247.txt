to think that,' it indicates strong indignation. In this and in many
other cases, where sanie and satin ut occur, Weise considers that they
may be expressed by the simple nonne; but it will be found upon ex·
amination that in many places nonne would very inadequately express
the force, and in others it is altogether out of place. Lastly, we have

I. ii. a. Argumenta] Argumentum is properly (see note on 1. i. 2)
‘something which pierces and carries conviction with it,' hence ‘a
proof‚' hence ‘reasoning’ hence .‘a discussion' or ‘dissertation' in
which argumenta are adduced‚ and hence the ‘subJect or theme of a
,discussion or dissertation' It is from the idea of movement implied
in reasons which ‘pierce and carry conviction with them,' that in is
here followed by pectus in the accusative: ‘I have raised discussions
and adduced proofs which might penetrate into my breast' To say,
with Lambinus, that in pectus is put for in pectore “antiquo more,'' is
little better than an attempt to conceal ignorance. Observe that in
the following line we have in corde notin cor,· after the discussions,
reasonings‚ and proofs had made their way into his breast, he then
turned thern over and arranged them “in corde.’' In o. 9, Ei rei
argumento de'enm means, ‘I will adduce proofs of what Ι assert‚' and
so vv. 15, 37‚while in a. 9 we have the same meaning expressed by ad
with the accusative, Auscultate argumenta dum dim admone rem. In
Trin. 11. iv. ranwe find nearly the same words, Ei rei argumentum -
dicam, which there signify, ‘I will prove to you that you ought to
follow my advice ;’ and in Truc. Ι. ii. 68, rimator semilis est oppidi
tosn‘tts. D. Quo argumento est? ‘How do you make that out θ’ ‘How
do you prove thatl' The transition is easy frorn n discussion to the
