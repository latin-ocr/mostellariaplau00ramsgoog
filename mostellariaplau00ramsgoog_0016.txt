and is well known as the author of the most complete and
systematie Manual of latin Proeody in the English language.
To the latest edition of that Manual he added an acute and
learned appendix on the so-oelled Saturnian verse, from which
it will he seen in how «τι-ἥλω] and sceptiml a spirit he was
prepared to deal with the various metrioel fancies of modern
German schola-s, while the critical notes of this edition will
show how rigorous he was in the demand for definite evidence
before admitting an emendation of the text on the grmnd of

In the present work, the great difficulties which beset the
prosody of Plautus, and especially the great question whether
the anomalies of Plautine metre nre to be explained by some

or by supposing a wholesale violation of the ordinary lawe of
Latin prosody, as these were observed by the later poets, cannot

authority of a scholar who had made the subject of prosody
his peculiar study, will have some value; the view adopted is
stated with some important modifications, and supported by
a large number of examples, many of thern included amongst
those which have been brought forward by Dr. Wagner and
others in support of the rival theory, and which are here shewn
to be capable of an easy explanation other than that advanoed
by them as part of their case. It is pointed out how few are
the words which can with any confidence be asserted to have
been used by Plautus with a quantity different from that ob-
served by later writers; and the impression is lest, that a cri-
tical examination into the objections commonly brought forward
to the theory of contractiori or ‘correptionf will be found to
have but little solid foundation; that the proof on the other
side is negative rather than positive3 while in proportion as
the difficulties attending that theory are removed, the argument
