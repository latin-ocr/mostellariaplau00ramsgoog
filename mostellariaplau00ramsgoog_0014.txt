but which, from the evidence of inscriptions, Mr. Ramsay held
himself entitled to conclude were in all probability actually
employed by Plautus himself. 1 have preferred to exhibjt an
orthography all but identical with that presented by the most
distinguished of the recent critics, especially Ritschl and Fleck-
eisen, aud which, so fas as the Mostellaria is concerned, is to
be found in an excellent form in the edition of that play by Aug.
l-orenz (18⁶6), forming part of the Haupt and Sauppe clmics.
Almost all the peculiarities which distinguish that ortho-
graphy have been sanctioned by Mr. Ramsay, and have been
therefore incorporated in the text. Thus p has been uniformly
substitute-⁴1 for b before s or t, as in apstinere, epti-ere, and the
like-3 ue (νο) is uniformly written for un (vu), except in the
words rum and nm, where, in deference to the authority of
Ritschl, 1 have retained the familiar mode of spelling:
ι is written for e in vos-ln, vortn and its compounds; apl-me,
maxumus, cmffex, etc. is written for nptias, etc.; p is in all
cases inserted between ιιι and either s or t following, while the
spellings fae-u, eanum, adulentur, guarin (the noun), and others
for which there is good MS. authority, are adopted throughout.
But, sor the reasons above stated, 1 have refraiued from
substituting eir lbr ie in datives and ablativos plural of the
first and second declensions, and from writing uniformly es in
all plural cases of the third, although Mr. Ramsay holds it ιο
be an older form than either ι’»- or eis ; nor have 1 ventured to
write quei, ιη’, quui, ibei, akei, etms, dein, etc„ though in all
those cases it can be shewn from inscriptions that the longer
form was that more commonly employed in the time of Plautus.
[t will be seen from the Prolegornena that the evidence of
inscriptions proves as certainly as that of MSS„ that in many
ωερε uniformity of spelling did not prcvail until a com-
paratively late period3 we see the rival forms side by side
in the same inscriptions, and we cannot doubt that in such
mses both forms were in use together, and that it was only
gradually and aster a long conflict that the older forms gave
