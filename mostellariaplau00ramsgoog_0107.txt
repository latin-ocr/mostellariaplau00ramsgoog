xc PROLEGOMENA.

where it is to be obaervcd that elision is neglected in the division of

the verse after laeuo. Nonius, p. 103, refers to this very line: “Ex-
paps'llato brachio, quasi usque ad papillam renudato. Plautus Milite
glorioso: id, censimum in numae leco, expapillato bracleh;” and the
expression expapillato brachie is aclmowledged by Paul. Diae, p. 79:
“Expapillato brachio, exserto: quod quurn fit, papilla nudatur.''
But on the other hand expaptlato appears in not one of the best
MSS, all of which seem to have had exfafillato brachii, and this in
one of the interpolated family appears as expalle'ato brachii). More·
over, Paul. Diae, p. 83, has, “Effafilatrem exsertum, quod scilicet
omnes exserto brachio sint expilati, id est, extra vestimentum filo
contextum.''

Now while we are free to repudiate the etymologica! explanation,
we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that there existed a phrase,
effafilato brachii), which was equivalent to exserto brachio, and it seems
highly probable that the word qfafilate, having become obsolete at
an carly period, was explained by grammarians by the more obviously
intelligible expapillato, and thus the latter found its way into the text.
It would be contrary to the natural and usual process to suppose
that expapillato, with regard to the force of which there would be no
doubt, would be changed into the forgotten effafilate. The conjecture
of Ο. Mttller, that safila in old Latin was equivalent to filule, is very
plausible; reading therefore, ,

Id connexum ln humera laeuo effafilato trachia
we can scan the line without difficulty, supposing the quantity of the
verb to bc either sisela or fissile· the ‚meaning vill clearly be, ‘The

but R. is disposed to allow the second vowel to remain short before

the double ll, and pronounce satillites, relying on Trin. IV. i. 14,
one of a series of Trochaic Tetrameters Acatalectic. He prims-

Dtslraxlssent disque tulissent satilliles tui meierum secde,

whereas all the MSS. have—
Distraxfssent desque tulissent satellites tul me miserunt secde,

and me seems to be required by the idiom of the language. Under
this shape the line is impracticable, and hence Hermann reads-
