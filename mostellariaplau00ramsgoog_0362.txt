here give ut, which the verse requires, and not utut of the Vulg. text:
the meaning will be ‘however (bad) the condition of my own affairs ;'
but Bentley renders it, ‘I rejoice in so far as the condition of my
own affairs permits me to rejoice! The combination utut occurs
several times in Plautus, where the reading is not doubtful, e. g. Most.
111. i. 14, Verum utut rese sese habet, Pergam turbare parra: ita haec
res postulat.

X.—FR VGI, NEQ VAM.

That frugi is frequently used as an indeclinable adjective by

writers of all epochs is unquestionable, and it is equally certain that ¹ ¹

it is the dative case of frux, frugis. In Plautus it is frequently
coustmed with sum, and may in that case be regarded as a real
dative: As. ll. iv. 91, quamquam ega rum sordidatus, Frugi tamen rum,·
Pers lv, i. 5, Simulus aar nequam est, male res uertunt quas agiu Sin
autem frugi est, mentun! frugaliter, and as if to mark the word more
distinctly as a substantive the epithet donae is often added; Pseud. Ι.
v. 53, Cupis maesse nequam, lamen era frugi barme; As, ΙΙΙ. iii. 12,
Numquam bonae frugi sr'ent, dies noctesque potent, while the accusative
frugem is occasionally found in the same sense; thus Trin. 1. ii. 81, .
Quin ad frugem eanregri? 11. i. 34, Certum ‘est ad frugem adplr'care
animum· Poen. IV . ii. 70, Herus si tuus uolctfacerefrugem; but in
many instances it must be regarded as indeclinable, as may be
observed in some of the examples given below.

The true meaning of frugi is clearly indicated by the etymology-
it is used to denote that a person is ‘profitable’ or ‘useful' either
to himself or to others. Thus it assumes many modifications of
meaning*

1. When used with reference to oue who is profitable to himself
it may signify ‘economical' or ‘thrifty' as in the' following lines,
where it is opposed to benignus: Truc. 1. i. 13, Tentat benegnusne an
benaesrugi sies-‚⁰ v. ao, sr' r'd quad aratur dedri, Atque cst bentgnus potrus
quam frugi boreae: or ‘ pmdent' Capt. II. ii. 44, Philocrates Iu'c fecit
hominem frugi ut facere oportuit: or ‘respectable,' Curc. IV. ii. 16,
Nec vobiscum quisquam r'n fora frugi cmrsa‘slere audem and so Aul. lv.
ix. 6, Quid esre quid relictis? navi amnes : scr'afures esse hic complures
