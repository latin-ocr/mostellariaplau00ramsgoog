ιιιιι ernestionem.

Mustela murem ΙΙ apstulit praeter pedes,·

80 all the MSS„ including A.
3. Tne Hepthemimeral Caesura in lambio Trim. Hiatus is less

common in this than in the Penthemimeral, but is by no means rare.

Most 1. i. 38,
Depre omncs perdant: oboluisti ΙΙ alleicm.
Men. 111. ii 11,
Prandi potavi, scortum accubui, ΙΙ apstuli.

Sometimes we lind a hiatus both in the Penth. and the Hepth. in

the same line, e. g., Most. 1. i. ao,
- Carrumpe herilem ΙΙ adulescentem ΙΙ optumum,

where Pylades soisted in filium, and Ritschl nostrum after haeum in
order to bolster up the metre. Rud. 111. vi. ιι,

Ego hune scelestum ΙΙ in aies rapiam ΙΙ exulem.

So also Mero. IV. iv. 15,
Vellere, amplecti ΙΙ osaelarl ΙΙ adloqui,
where, is it were worth while, we might avoid the hiatus by writing
amplectier and osculars'er.
We find in Trin. 11. iv. 138,139, two lines in succession which
appear in all the best MSS. under the form-

Nam fulguritae sunt alternae ΙΙ arbores
Sues moriuntur angina ΙΙ acerrume.

In the former Camer. inserts lu'c aster nent, and is followed by W„
while R. foists in ibt· in the second, Hermann has hec alter angina,
R. basilii, Lind. transposes and reads-

Sues angina mutantur acerruma,
leaving the last syllable in nasaniae long, and in his presace quotes
this as an example of this peculiar prosody.
4. Wherever there es a drinnct pause in tle sense. Even Virgil

thought himself justified in writing, Eel. 11. 53,
Addam cerea pruna: ΙΙ lonas erit luc'c quaque pona.
Et uera incessu patuit Dea. ΙΙ Ille uli matrem.

Thus Capt. III. iii.17,

’ Nugas ineptiasque incepsa. ΙΙ - Haeret.

Cist. II. iii. ιι,

Age, perge, quaeso .· ΙΙ animus aude're expetit. ’

5. A fortiori when there is a transenna in tle melldle as a verse scam
au speaker to another: thus Merc. I. ii. 74,

C. Quipatuit creuere) ΙΙ Α, Oculis. C. Qua pactol ΙΙ Α. Hcante'lus,·
