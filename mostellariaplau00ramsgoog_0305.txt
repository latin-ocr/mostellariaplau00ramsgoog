28. Vel banereem e'ube aedis mancupia poscere] Since hommem in
v. 26 refers to Simo, it might appear harsh to make hamr'nem in this
line refer to Philolaches, and to translate ‘order Philolaches to de·
mand ς’ hut we may regard hominem aedis as the double accusative
aiter pascere, ‘order (your son) to make a demand upon the man
(Simo) sor the house! The emendation posce, proposed by Dousa
and adopted by Bothe and Weise, is not sanctioned by any MS, and
isunnecessary. ln any case the meaning of the passage is ‘make
a demand to have the house legally conveyed under a clear title?
Plautus here, as in many other places, altogether lorgets that a Greek
is speaking who would not employ the technical phrases of Roman
law. Since houses were Res Meneupe', the Danuuium or absolute right
ol property could in ancient umes be conveyed to a purchaser by the
ceremony ol Mancupetea only, and hence the phrases mancupea pro-
mittere, dare mancupra, recepere mancupia, poscere mancupea. There
is a good illustration in Trin. 11. iv. 19, Mem quadraginta accepisti
a Callicle, Et ille aedes aps te accepit mancupia. Slaves also were Res
Maneupe', and when a slave was made over to a new master by
mancupatr'a it was held as a guarantee that the seller possessed do·
melariam, or absolute right os property in the slave, and il, under any
circumstances, it afterwards turned out that he did not really possess
any such right, then he was bound to reimburse the purchaser.* ll
however the slave was sold without mancupalr'a, then the buyer made
the purchase suo pere'culo, at his own risk, and had no recourse upon
the seller. Thus in the Persa, where the plot turns upon the iraudulent

* Hence Manceps signifies one who becomes security, Cure. IV. ii. 29,
Ego mancipem te nihil maror nec lenonem alium quemquam.
