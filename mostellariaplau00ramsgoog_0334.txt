EXCVRSVS IV.-IMO. 201

pessumum In denegando modo quis pudor paululum adest, ‘is it really
true, (you will ask, that there are such persons. Yes, there are, but
bad as these are whom I have described, they are not the worst sort
of peoplez) no, the worst are those who’ fec, and then he proceeds
to characterize a class.

III. In certain cases e'mo may be translated ‘yes,’ but this happens
only when ema is used in reply to a negative proposition, and where
‘yes’ is in reality equivalent to ‘on the contrary ;' Aul. 111. vi. 9,
E. Neque, pal, lllegadore, mihi neque cus'quam pauperi Opinione meleies
res structa esf domi. M. Ima esf, et De'sacs'ant uli siet, &cr here sino
contradicts the negative proposition introduced by neque, ‘yes it is
(i. e. on the contrary, it is, tlte.) ;’ Bac. ll. iii. 81, N. Sed aas nihilne

adfule'sh's s’nde auri mnam? C. Ima, emam, oerum mantum adtulerit
nescia: here s'rao refers to nehel, ‘have you not brought any gold
home from thencel’ ‘Yes, we have (i. e. on the contrary, we have),
even now, but how much 1 know not ;' Hec. 11. i. 31, S. Nan mea
operamque pol calpa eaene'f. L. Imo maxume: here e'rno refers to
non . . . neque, ‘ yes, (i. e. on the contrary) it did, in the highest degree ς’

Adel. ll. ii. 39, S. Num puellari· quan abeam? Ima hercle hoc quaeso,
Sure: ‘You don't want anything‚ do you, to hinder me from going
awayl' S. ‘Yes‚ (on the contrary, I do want something) 1 have to
beg of you' &c.; Hec. V. iv. 35, Pam Ilsescri, Parmeno, Quantam
hade‘e prefuerit melei, ef ex quanta aerumna extraxeris. Pan. Imo vero
scio: neque hoc inprudenssece’: ‘You don't know! ‘Yes, (on the con·
trary,) I do know very well:’ or we might translate, ‘no, I am not
ignorant, I do know well;’ Cas. 11. vi. 30, Stalino, Chalinus, and
Olympio are wrangling before proceeding to cast lots: S. Quod
bonum atqaesorfunafum melie'ss't. 0. lavassemus: C. Non. 0. Ima
hercle. C. Ima milei hercle. Stalino having prayed that the result
may be fortunate for himself, Olympio adds, ‘be it so, and for me
also‚’ upon which Chalinus interposes, ‘no (not for you) ;' Olympio
retorts‚ with reference to the non of Chalinus, ‘ yes, (on the contary,)
for me, I say,' and then Chalinus, ‘no, not for you, but for me :'
here, in the same line, we may translate the first emo by ‘yes' and
the second by ‘no,' but there is, in reality, no inconsistency, for in
each case emo is employed to contradict the preceding speaker.

In the following passage eina conveys dissent from the form in
which the preceding speaker expresses himself, but assent to the
substance of his proposal; Epid. Il. ii 95, E. Vbi eri! empta, ut
alepuo ex urbe amoveas: nisi quali tua Serus sentenle'a est. P. Ima, docte.

Epidicus says, ‘thisis the plan thCh l recommend,’ and then adds
