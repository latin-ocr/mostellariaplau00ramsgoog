xxviii PROLEGOMENA.

IVDICIVM, IVDICIO, IVDICET, IVDICARE, IVDICETVR,
IVDICATA, also IOVSERIT and IVSERIT; IOVRET, IOV-
RENT, IOVRATO, and IVRATO‚ 1vRAR1T.

The case oi long i deserves particular consideration. We find
a multitude ol examples from the earliest inscriptions downwards,
in which it is represented byei, and this both in terminations and
roots. Thus, VIRTVTEI, QVEI [1]‚ QVEI, GESISTEI,
SEI [4], QVOIEI, VIRTVTEI, QVEI [5], ΡΕΤΙΕΙ, SIBEI
[7]‚ QVEI, FOIDERATEI, EXDEICENDVM, NEIQVIS,
SEI, QVEI, SIBEI, DEICERENT‚ VTEI, VBEI, IBEI,
CEIVIS, NISEI, OINVORSEI VIREI, NISEI, INCEIDERE
TIS, PREIVATOD [10].

But this mode ol representing long i was not observed with
anything approaching to uniformity even in our most ancient
authorities: thus, AIDILIS [1]‚ AIDILES, AIDILIS, BAR-
BATI [8], PVBLI, CORNELI [4], ACCVMVLAVI, GENVI,
OPTENVI [7], but ln the same inscription PETIEI [7]‚
VENIRENT, AVDITA, VRBANI, COVENTIONID, SACRI
[10].

The absolute uncertaimy which prevailed upon this poInt is proved
by the Lex Thoria, ln which we find not only FRVEI and FRVI,
HEREDEI and HEREDI, DEICITO and EDICITO, AGREI and
AGRI, both in the genitive, but such combinations as POPVLEI
ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMANI; AGREI
LOCEI, AGRI LOCEI, AGRI LOCI; POPVLI LEIBEREI,
and many others*

This uncertainty seems to have disturbed literary men, for Lucssius
mdeavoured to lay down rules which might determine the cases in
which ei should be employed to denote the long vowel, and those
in thch the simple i should be used. Quintilian'r Velius Longus,‡
and Terentius Scaurusi all referto the principles which he sought
to establish, and quote his words, but the passages are so obscure
and corrupt that it is very difficult to ascertain what his views really
were. lt would seem that in nouns ol the second declension he

wished to distinguish the numbers by writing μκή, viri in the
genitive singular and Μετ’, vr'rei in the nominative plural, while in
nouns ol the third declensIon he wrote ei in the dative singular, as

nscior ln the Lex Servilia, LEITIS and LITIS; DEIXERIT and
