Asst'milation.

It is natural to conclude that the sostening os prepositions in
composition by assimilation should have become more and more
general as the cultivation ol the language advanced, but it is a
decided mistahe to suppose that the practice was altogether unknown
in early times. The statement oi Pim'us, in his note on the line
(Virg. Aen. IV. 175), Mobt'lt'tatc ur‘get vt'resque adpur'rr't eunde, “Antiqua
pene omnia exemplaria integras servant praepositiones in compo·
sitis, ut adquirit: et ita scribi solitum usque ad Aurelii Antonini Pii
tempora, publica declarant monumenta‚” can be at once disproved
by many ol the “ publica monumenta '’ to which he appeals. Setting
aside the change oi ab, ob, into ap, op, dcc, ol which we shall speak
below, and which may depend upon different considerations, we find
in 7 ACCVMVLAV13 ACCIPIO and its tenses are used in early
inscriptions to the exclusion oi the harder adapz'o, and occur in
11,12‚14‚ 10 quater, 10 putitquies, 20 bis, and also in n. 818 bis and
819; so ACCVSASSE [20], ATINGAT, ATTIGAT, ATTIN·
GAT, ATTIGERET [12], AVFERATVR [18 bz's], COMVO·
VISSE [10], COMVALEM [18], COMPORTENT [14].

These examples are quite sufficient to disprove the broad asser·
tion that assimilation was unknown until the time ol Antoninus Pius,
but on the other hand it is unquestionable that in early inscrip
tions, in the great majority ol cases prepositions in composition
undergo no change. Thus we have ADFERATVR, ADSIGNARE,
ADSIDVO, ADTRIBVERE, CONLATA, CONLEGA, CONLF:
GIVM, CONLEIBERTVS, CONLOCARE, CONPLVRIBVS,
CONPROMESISE, CONRIGI, DISMOTA, EXDEICENDVM,
INGNOMINIAE, lNMlTTERE, INMORTALlVM, INPEDITVS‚
INPONITO, INPROBARINT, INPROBVM, INPVLSVM, IN·
ROGARE, and others.

In a few esses there seems to have been uncertainty; thus we find
cortenovowx and coMerowT noui rn 13, rwesxrvru*
and its cases in 11,12,14, IMPERIO [10], INPERARE [14],
INPERATO [18], IMPERATOR [20], and uniformly in all

[* See Munro's Lucretius, vol. 11. p. 26, where the want of uniformity
in the spelling of this word and its compounds is dwelt upon and an
explanation suggested—Eu]
