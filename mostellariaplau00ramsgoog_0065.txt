xlviii PROLEGOMENA.

sim 191 sonat: iam onim supra docui non sonare debere tametsi in
scriptura m posita sit.” Cf Caesell. ap. Cassiodor. p. 9314, and
isidor. Origg. 1, 26 post med. But although it is here said that we
ought to write tamtus and quamtus, we have no reason to believe
that these words ever were written under that form, and therefore
we must regard this as merely a theoretical speculation as to what
ought to have been, not what actually was..

N is occasionally omitted, in old inscriptions, in the middle of
aword‚ but not apparently upon any tired principle: thus in 2,
COSOL, CESOR, COSENTIONT, but we have CONSOL‚ CEN-
SOR, in another part of the same inscription, and also in 13 in 10,
COSOLORETVR thrice‚ but also CONSOLVERVNT, COVEN·
TIONID. The abbreviations Cos. and Coss. for Consule, Consulibus,
seem to have originated in the use ol Cosot for Consul.

There exists great diversity of opinion upon this point among an·
ciem grammarian«. Priscian, pp. 551, 564, 854, 897, 898, 931, writes
hr'enes, dempsi, compsi, prompsi, sumpsi and demptus, 1911191111, 9199191111,
sumptus, 1111191191111191111, redemptus, and also emptus. Terent Seaur.,
pp. 2256, 9961, admits that it was common to write sumptus, demptus,
comptus, but callsp in this case “supervacua'' and argues that the
introduction of it is irrational. At the same time he tells us that there
was a dispute whether hiems or hiemps was the correct orthography,
and decides in favour 91 the former. Papirian. ap. cassiodor, p. 9999,
rejects hiemps, but says that sumpsi, sumptus, sumpturus, must be
written with ap. Beda, pp. 9337, 9346, rejects hiemps, but adopts
sumpsi, sumpturus. Mar. Victorin, p. 9466, 1191919 upon writing
hiems, 11191111, mssemsit, demsr't, and utterly rejects such forms as
consumptum, emptum, temptat, attemptat.

Thus we see that while Priscian, Terentianus Scaurus, Papirianus‚
and Beda agree in writing sumpsi, sumptus, dempsi, demptus, compsi
comptus, emptus, and the like, Marius Victorinus rejects thep in each
case. All seem to agree in prefening he'enrs to hiemps.¹¹

Setting aside 1111111, inscriptions insert thep in the above words
and their derivativcs more frequently than they omit it. But a good
many examples 91 both occur.
