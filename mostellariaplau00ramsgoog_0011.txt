w PREFACE

· there was much that was perplexing and that could only have

Ι been explained by the writer himself. Hardly any part of the
work was absolutely complete, Ι could not tell what portions
had been finally revised, or at what period the different portions
had been written, and in some particulars, trifling in them-
selves no doubt,I found just so much inconsistency as would
spring from a gradual ripening of opinion, and would seem
to shew that while each portion of the subject had been
minutely studied in itself, there was wanting that larger and
fuller review which gathers together the various fragments of
a subject in a single grasp, and gives them the unity of a
whole. At the same time, the MS. contained so much that

as now published is as perfect as he intended it to be, though
it may omit much that he would have included, and include
what he might have excluded‚ it contains nothing but what
he wrote3 and my work has been almost entirely limited to
that of an editor in the strictest sense.

Ι have arranged and put together the various fragments of
the work, including everything which I thought of value, and
omitting whatever was manifestly incomplete, or seemed to re-
quire more revision than the mere correction of inaccuracy. In
many cases Ι have found it necessary to supply the phraseology:
in others I have had to supply the connection. Where it has
been necessary to fill up a gap in the sense, or to indicate
more fully the line of an argument, l have enclosed my own
additions within brackets. And as there are some points, as
to which, not having enough to guide me as to the authofs
