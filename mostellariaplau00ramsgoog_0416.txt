EXCVRSVS XVIL-T'ERMS OF ABUSE, du. 283

and Cas 11. vi. 37, 0. Taceo: Deos quaeso. . . C. Vt quedem tu hodie
canem et furcam seras! 0. Me‘hi ut sortitio mmrat. C. Vt quidem,
hercle, pedibus pendeas! 0. At tu ut oculos emungare ex capite per
uasura tuost ‘but Ipray that you may blow your eyes out through
your nosel’

4. Acljurations. No one can fail to be struck by the multitude
of adjurations with which the dialogue in Plautus and Terence is
interlarded, and which are, for the most part, mere expletives, desti-
tute os any particular emphasis, corresponding to the ‘Gad,’ ‘Bedad,'
‘Faith’ ‘By Jove,’ and a hostes others, with which many of our
dramatists were wont to season the discourse of their characters.

The words of this kind which appear to have been most in favour
with the Romans were, as might be anticipated‚ appeals to their
popular deities, the Great Twin Brethren and Hercules expressed
by Pol, Edepol, Mecastor, Ecastor, Hercle, &c

Pol is manifestly an abbreviation of Pollux, and is used either as
an independent ejaculation or in connection with verbs and such
adverbs as certe, seru, profecto. The combination Per pol, found in
Hec. I. i. 1, Per pol quara paucos reperias meretricibus Fideles avaie're
arcatores, Sura, is so strange that commentatore have sought to
explain it by tmesis, conjoining the per with quari.

Edepol hasbeen held ῑο be a contraction for per aedem Pollucis,
and hence is sometimes printed aedepol, but it is probably merely
another form of Epol, which is found occasionally in the MSS. of
Plautus. Pol and Edepol in the extant Latin writers are freely used
by men and women alike.

Maesta, we cannot doubt, stands for me, Castor, iuva, or me
Castor iuvet, ‘so help me, Castor,’ as Mareotes or Mehercule stand
for rue, Hercules, ruva, or rae lucentes iuuet, and Meduafide'us lor mc,
Dius Edrias, e‘uaa, or rue Dius Erillus iieaet, ‘so help me, God of
Truth'

Ecastor, although explained like Edepol to be a contractiori for
per aedera Castoris, seems to be simply the name Castor with the
ejaculatory particle e prefixed, as in Equirine (Paul. Diae. p. 81, ed.
ulau), Eiuro (Charis. p. 183, ed. Puta), and Epol, notieed above.

Heracle or Hercle* are the forms in which the invocation of this
deity generally appears in Plautus and Terence; Mehercle, although
not without example, is rare-Eun. 1. i. 22, 111. i. 26. The following

passage from Aulus Gellius, XI. 6, is curious: ‘⁸ In veteribus scriptis ·

* Cic. Orat. XLVII. ᾗ 157, “Et pomeridianas quadrigas quam postmeri-
diauas libentius dixerim, et mehercule quum mehercules.''
