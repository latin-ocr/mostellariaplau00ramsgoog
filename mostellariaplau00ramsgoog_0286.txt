NOTES. 111. i. 4¹· 153

passages: Cure. V. ii. 15, Quod argentum, quas iu mihi irc‘car narras?
Pers. V. ii. 17, Quid ais, crux, chordorum irr'torr' quomodo me hodie
oorsooisti! Vc mc in trr'cus coracesii! In Rud. V. ii. 36, Tricas! means
‘pshaw,’ ‘nonsense,' ‘mere trash3’ Pers IV. iii. 61, netu mihi opus
cst Lch'bro neque tre'cri, i. e. ‘quibbles’ Cicero uses the word iu
the sense of ‘ embarrassments,’ ‘hindrances ι’ domesticos irr'cus, ad Ata
x 8, sub. lin. See also Caelius in ad. Fam. VIII. 5. The original
aud proper meaning ol tricae seems to have been ‘threadq’ aud from
the passage quoted above from Pers. V. ii. 17 compared with IV. i. 9,

’ it is clear that it denoted ‘a noose’ or ‘snare ;' hence the transitIon

is easy to ‘a triclr’ or ‘deception,' and hence, as in Pers. IV. iii. 61,
it means ‘paltry legal tricks’ or ‘quibbles,' and hence in Rud. V.

ii. 36 the exclamation tricas! is one ol contempt,—‘ what you offer
is a paltry subterfuge ;' and it may be observed that the expression
oi contempt used by Gripus iu the next clause is tremas puirr'das.
Lexicographers have sought adifferent origin and explanation of the

word, referring to Pliny H. N. III. ii. ξ 16, where he is discussIng
the geography os Apulia. He mentions Arpi as having been founded
by Diomedes and named Argos Hippium, which was subsequently
cormpted into Argyrippa, and then goes on, Diomedes ibi delevit genter
Monadorum Dardorumquc ei urbes duas quae in proverbi ludr‘crum
uertere, Apamam et Tricam. The proverb itself is to be found in
Martial XIV. i. 7, who, when about to write a series os distiches
descriptIve of the small gilts interchanged by all classes at the
Saturnalia, says, Sunt ape'ecae tricaeque ei si quid or'lr‘ccs citri, ‘they are,
I admit, trash and rrumpery3' and again, 1. cxiv. a, Quaecumque lusi
iuuenis et puer quondam Apricarque nostras, quas nec ipse eom nooi, ac.
Now although the Romans may have been unable to explain the
origin os the proverbial expression Apemae Tricceque, and although
we may find it difficult to give any account of Aptare, no sober·
minded philologIst will be willing to accept and rest satislied with
the story os Pliuy about the two towns destroyed by Diomedes.
Non. Marcellus p. 8, seems to consider that tricae is the same
word as the Greek τρίχες, “Tricce sunt impedimenta et implicationes
dictae quasi sericae quod pullos gallinaceos involvant et impediant
capilli pedibus implicati.’' Tricoom's in the sense os ‘a shufflIng lmave'
› or ‘cheat’ is quoted twice by Nonius (s. v. Tricores, p. aa) from Lu*
cilius, lucru’ Coae senex, Crassi pater lruiei Panaeti Magnus lrc‘cosuc'i
nummarii! solvere nulli, Lentus,· and agam (s. v. Tricce, p. 338), Nec
me'lri amatore hoc opu nec¹ trr'cone vadato: and the word reappears

again in the Augustan HIstorIans (Capitolin. Ver. 4.) in the sense
