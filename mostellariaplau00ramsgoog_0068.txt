Is, before going further, we endeavour to ascertain what the
ancients thought on this matter, we shall find that those who vere
best qualified to jndge were blind to the extreme skffl and grace
which some modern eritius have discovered in the Iambic Trium-ter
of the comio writers, and it is amusing to tenuant the expression·
of Cioero and Ritstzhl.

dinem sermonis sic saepe sunt abiecti senarii, ut nonnumquam vix
in eis numerus et versus intelligi possitl'

The latter, when arguing against the admission os the hiatus under
certain circumstances. exclaims indignasttly, “Et hoc ut artis fiuent?
et Plautinae artis, cuius tantam in reliquis partibus senariorum sep-
tenariorumqoe condendorum omnibus elegantiam merito admiramur ν’
And yet Cicero was cenairtly familiar with, md greatly admired, the
early literature os his own country, and was moreover an accom-
pushed Greek scholas.

From Priscian we leam that even in his time there were persons,
we must suppose with some pretensiona to learning, who asserted
that there were no mel-res at an in Terence, while others pretended
that they were of n mystenous, recondite character, and known to
themselves alone. ln the MSS. much confusion prevails as to the
arrangement of lines, and the editor os the Edl'llb Princeps seems to
have been almost completely ignorant os the subject, and in many
cases to have made scarcely an attempt to distribute the words
into verses.

Now although many difficulties present themselves when we
pmceed to scan particular lines, and although runeh diversity os
opinion exista with regard to the precise laws which the drzrnafists
imposed upon themselves in eonstructing their verse. it must be
observed that, except in some partim-lar cases to he noticed below,
there is no more difficulty in determining the classes and speeies of
verse employed than in the worlts ol' Virgil and Hor-ace. We can
