Medic. fac. 73, Nec cerussa tibi, ner m'trr' spuma rubentis Desit, et
Illyrica quae venit iris huma, but here it forms part ol a complicated
recipe. We find the word cerussatus quoted from Cic. in Pison. XI.
(cemusatuque buccae, when describing the general appearance ol
Gabinius), but all the MSS. here are corrupt, and present pulsatae,·
it occurs, however, in Martial VII. xxv. a, Dulcia eum tamtum scm‘bas
epigrammata semper Et cerussata canmathra cute. There is another
Ep. ol Mart in which cerussa is mentioned, X. xxii, Cur spunrato
saepe prodeam mento Albane pictus sana labra cerussa, Philaeni, quaeris?
basiare te nolo.

102. Atramentum] when used to denote a black pigment, is what
we call lamp-llari, and the mode in which it was usually prepared
is distinctly described in Plin. H. N. XXXV. 6, p 25, Fit erum e fuligine
pluribus modr's, resr'na vel pice exustis, propter quodetiam officinas aedifi·
cauere sumum eum non emittentes. Cl.Vitruv.VII.10. Apelles and
Micon are said to have used atramentum made from the charcoal ol
grape·st0nes, while Apelles also employed bone-black obtained from
ivory. (Plin. ic.) Atramentum libranum, orwriting-ink, was composed
by mixing atramentum with gum, while in atramentum tectorium, lor
stuccoing the walls oi rooms, glue was the vehicle. (vitruv. ic.)
Totally distinct from the atramentum described above was what the
Romans called atramentum suetonum, and the Greeks χολιιινθον. This,
as is evident from the description oi Pliny (H. N. XXXIV . 532), was
sulphatc ol ison, which, when applied to tanned leuther‚ would stain
it black, forming exactly the compound which constitutes the common
writing ink ol modern times*

t - posteras] i. e. ‘you may as well try (expect) at the same time
to whiten ivory with lamphlack! It is commonly set down in
books upon Latin Synonyms that postulo is the strongest ol all the
verbs which signily ‘to seek’ or ‘to ask ior,’ and that it denotes that
the person employing it peremptorily demands something to which
he has an unquestionable right. This is however by no means the
common force os the word when used colloquially. We shall find
a great number oi passages in the dramatists where it means simply
‘to desire‚' ‘to want,’ or ‘to try to do something,’ and ‘to expect to
be able to do ;' in addition it sometimes conveys the idea that a

* When Cic. lipp. Fam. lX. 21, speaking of Cn. Carbo the partizan ·
of Marius sayS, lam pateretur, arcessatur a M. Antonia, sutorio atramenta
absolutus putatur, he probably means that he poisoned himself with this
substance, but the explanation is uncertain. Galen reckons it among
poisons. Consult Pereira.
