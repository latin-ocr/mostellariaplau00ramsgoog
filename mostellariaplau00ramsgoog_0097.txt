indicate nothing except that the syllables over which they are placed
receive the Ictus Metrieus or are In Arrr'; and there can be no
objection to their use, since they frequently gulde a young scholar
to the proper scansion of the line, although the object would be more
fully attained if the quantity of each syllable were marked according
to the practice followed in some editions of Caesar and other ‘First
Reading Books,' for the use of those commencing the study of the

lantlillgaelthough we must regard the views of Bentley, of Hermann,

of Lindemann, and their followers, as untenable, taken as awhole, .

it by iro means follows that we must give up the inquiry in despair.
Many of their remarks are most just and valuable, and will prove
of the greatest service, if we pursue the investigation according to
a rational system. Two things are essential—

ι. We must not form atheory founded upon a limited induction,

and then insist upon forcing reluctant facts into accordance with it3 .

but,

a. We must carefully collect all those words which present ano-
malies in quantity, and then endeavour to ascertain whether they
form an incongruous heap, or whether they admit of being, to a
certain extent at least, grouped and classified. If we succeed in
classifying them, we may, lastly, proceed to inquire whether there
is any principle which will serve to explain our difficulties.

We may begin by what may be called a natural arrangement;

r. Words in which the vowel is apparently shortened before a
consonant at the end of the word followed by a consonant at the
beginning of the next word. Ι

a. Words in which a vowel is apparently shortened before two
consonants in the same word.

3. Lastly, we may consider the case of those vowels or syllables
which, although not affected by the Rule of Position, exhibit in the
dramatists a quantity different from that assigned to them by the
practice of later writers.

To class r belong the following words, the last syllables of which
seem to be occasionally, many of them frequently, leil short before
a word beginning with a consonant: Apud, Amor, Bonus, Capul,
Canem, Color, Domus, Enrhr, Fores, Foras, Herm, Manus, Malus,
Ilfrhas, Miser, Modus, Mhrrl, Pater, Potest, Quidem, Senex, Stinul,
Soror, Tamen, Volunt.

Under class a are ranlred the following words, the last syllables
of which seem to be occasionally, many of them frequently, left short
