NOTES. ΙΙ. ii. 57·⁶²· 149

Mirum φαίη te advorsus derat, i. e. ‘it is very likely that he (your own
slave) will contradict youl'*. Aul. Ι. ἰί. 7, Mirum φαίη tua nuuc me
causosocial Iuppiter Philippum regem aut Dareum, triumeficat i. e. ‘it
is very likely, is it not, that Iupiter, for your sake, will make us n'ch
as king Philip or Dariusi’ Cist. IV. ii. 67, Halisca, when inquiring
for the cistella which she had lost, says, Nou edepol praeda magna, ‘it
would be no great prize to any one who has found it,’ to which
Lampadiseus replies, Mirum quin grex αιηαίίηη in cistella insumit
uua, i. e. ‘it is very likely, is it not, that there should be a troop of
slaves (or anything else of value) in that box of yours1'† Merc. 1. 91,
Mirum φαίη me subagitarett ‘it's very likely, isn't it, that he would
take liberties with me l’ and so exactly Pers. Ill. i 11, iii. 28 ; Rud. V.
iii. 37; Trin. IV. ii. 125. There is a passage in Pers. 111. iii 37, in
which merum is followed by φαίη, but they are disconnected by a long
stop,and hence the meaning is different3 T. Forlasse metreis ίη manum
concredere. D. Mirum: φαίη cium ram asaro argmtorii Abeunt, quam
im cursu rotula circumvertitur, ie. ‘you are perhaps afraid to trust
her in my hands (without paymeut down),' to which Dordalus replies
with a sneer, ‘that is wonderful, isn’t itl whyI tell you that now-
a-days (even) bankers levant more rapidly than awheel turns round
when rolling along! The phrases mirum ηί, mira suut ηί, mira suut
mii, are altogether distinct ; they express real surprise or wonder, and
mean literally, ‘l shall be surprised if so and so is not the case,' but
generally may be correctly expressed by our ‘I shouldn't wonder if so
and so is the case3’ thus Amph. I. i 163, illirium ni hic me quasi
muraenam exossare cogitat, ‘I shall be surprised if this fellow is not
thinking of boning me as if lwere amuraena,' ie. ‘I believe that
,this fellow is,' ‘I shouldn’t wonder if he were ;’ o.127,Mirasuut
ηίιί invitabit sese ίη cerea plieseulum, ie. ‘I shouldn’t wonder if he
had been taking a drop too much last night ;' and again, o. 275,
Mira sunt nesi latuil emtus ellic ίη ellac hirnea, i.e. ‘I shouldn’t be
surprised if that fellow was lying concealed in that wine jar 3' Bac. III.
iii. 46, Miro sunt ηί Pistoclerus Ludum pagetis contudit, ‘I shouldn't
wonder if P. had been giving L. a beating;' Cas. 111. ii. 24, Atque
edepol mirum ηί subolet ίαηι hoc lure veermae meae, ‘indeed I shouldn’t
wonder if the lady my neighbour had got an inkling of this already ;'
Trin. IV. ii. 19, Quam neeges specto, ηιίηαι placet mili homim's jacies:
nte'ra sunt Ni illic homo est aut dormitator, aut sector sonorius, ‘I

* Weise quite misunderstood the force of this when he renders it velim
eum advorsus te idem edicere, b. e. repetere quod modo dixit.
† Here again W. has completely misunderstood the meaning.
