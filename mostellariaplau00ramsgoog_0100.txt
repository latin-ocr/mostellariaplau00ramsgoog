trisyllahle (=mily5rls) in Most. 1. iii. ¹3 [Troch. Tem Cat), where
all the MSS, have,

Non mam amasam amant auam:- ιω aemi sarm.

Pylai, Bothe, und R. have re-written ὼε line in vurious ways: 1
would scan it,

Nem vestim amallons Ι aman! 11 malylri' Ι red milti’fizrltune.

ln verbs, Riischl allows that tria in all its parts, and aluo nertio, &cu
admit nynizesis sreely,· ais and ait my be monosyllables, md asban
in ²11 iis persons a dissyllable. Such forms u nudabam, ac„ he
regerds as gmmmafical rather than metrias, md with these excep-
tiens be hys down a ennon ilm. in che case os verbs (as in the case
os nouus, with the exception os diu, duis, and mm), the letter ι’
never soi-ms 2 synizesis with any vowel following it in the more
regular men-es, bnt only in Oenomai-iaus md Ampoests. But we
have nn undoubted instance os φανῇ] in Cupi. 111. v. ⁵ (Senam),

Nam semper accan! priusquam ἱππεῖ mlin'.

which R* would attempt violently ιο get rid of by substituting sarim,
ι form unhenrd os elsewhere. So αηιῦιΐῐιι, Mil. 1. ⁶⁹ (Senam), where
all the MSS. have,

Modestiae sunl, orant, ambffint, opsecrant.

In the same manner R. vninly endeavours to get rid oi evmssae, Trin.

Again, without any reference to the exigenda os vem-ming,
there wns a tendency in the lnnguage io drop altogether the v when
it occurred between two vowels, md ω conum the vowels imo one

prouidens, we have nobilni, momentum, iunior, nuper. prudens, αις
