Sed, the conjunctim, is not found in 1-2o; it occurs on one of
the curious brazen “sortes'' n. 1442, and a reference is made in
the index to Sed, in n. 12203 but there must be some mistake in the
number, for Sed is certainly not found in that inscription*

Under these circumstances there would appear to be no pretext

for departing from the ordinary orthography of any one of the ten'
words in question.

D Paragogr'cum.

lt is well lrnown that in the earlier stages of the Latin language
we find many words ending with ad, which was entirely dropped
at a later period. Grammarians have given to the letter thus

* To prevent mistalres we must call the attention of the young scholar
to the fact that in the older forms of the language hc will find two words,
Sed, distinct from the conjunction and from each other. r. Sed, which is
equivalent to Sine, and which enters into some ancient legal forms; the ex·
pression se fraude being introduced to declare that the doer of certain acts,
performed ministerially,sh0uldbe relievedfrom responsibility. Thus, in frag·
ment of the Laws of the Xll. Tables, preserved b Aul. Geli. XX. 1, ς 49,
“ Tertiis . Nundinis . Partis. Secanto . Si . Plus. inus .Ve . Secuerunt.
Se ,Fraude . Esto ;” and in the Lex Servilia (12), “ Eam . Pequniam.
Eis. Se . Frude . Solvito;” and again in the same Law, “,ld . Quaestor.
. . . . Sed . Fraude . Sua. Extra . Ordinem. Dato. Solvitoque.” See
Paul. Diae. s. v. p. 336, ed. Miill. a. sed, the accusative of Sui, with
what is called the D paragogicum. See next Section.
