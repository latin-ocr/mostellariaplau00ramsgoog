viii PROLEGOMENA.

a very pale brown, while the ink of others is unusually black. Again,
in the same play, portions os several pages have been lest blank, and
as these blanks do not indicate any gap in the sense, and occur be·
lore a change in the hand, it seems reasonable to inser that different
scribes had different portions ol the play allotted to them, without
any nice calculation as to the accurate union ol the portione.

The MS. has been ruled throughout, generally with some blunt·
pointed instrument which marked the vellum without ruffling the
sursace. The lines however are in many cases irregular, being
closer to each other in some parts of the same page than in others,
while the number ol lines in different pages varies much, the general
number however contained in one page being fifty-one or fifty-two.
ln some cases, e. g. in portione ol the Rudens, the pages are written
in double columns. Irregular as is the execution of the work, the
writing is notwithstanding legible throughout, the contractioris are
few and for the most part simple.

As to the division ol the words, the statement of Ritschl, “Verborum
distinctio aut nulla est aut prava,’' is not borue out, at least as far as
the Mostellaria is concemed, as in this play the words are for the
most part correctly divided in the llIS. There is no division into
acts; but in some plays the different scenes are diatihguished, a space
being left at the end ol each in which are inserted in red ink the
names of the persons who take part in the following scene. ln like
manner, the changes ol person in the dialogue are careiully indicated
hythe insertion of the speakers name in red ink, either at the be·
ginning ol the line or in aspace lest for the purpose in the middle
ol' the line as the case may be. This however does not apply to all
the plays, in some of which great irregularity prevails. In the Persa,
for example, although spaces have been left marking the divisions
ol the scenes, the names os the characters have been inserted in five
or six cases only, while, although spaces are lest to indicate the
transition from one speaker to another in the dialogue, the names
have in no case been inserted. In all probability the names of the
characters were added aster the plays were transcribed and bya
different hand; a view which derives confirmation from the fact that
while in some plays they are written in red ink, in others, eg. the
Curculio, Cartha, Eprilicur, in black, which in some cases has been
written or painted over with red, in some cases, e. g. conspicuously
in the Persa, the blanks have never been filled up at all, and while
Roman characters are generally employed in some plays, Greek
characters have been made use ol in others.
