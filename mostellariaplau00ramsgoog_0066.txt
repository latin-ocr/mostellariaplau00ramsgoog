ORTHOGRAPHY. xlix

Some forms oi orthography seem to have been adopted hy the very
earliest Roman writers, which, like the duplication oi the vowel, passed
away at once: thus Priscian, p. 556, tells us on the authority oi
Varro, “de origine Linguae Latinae‚” that the “vetustissimi auctores

Romanorum '' wrote Agchises, agcepr, aggulus, aggero, agguilla, igge-
runt, for Anchises, anceps, angulus, angens, ongm'lla, eligerunt, as the
Greeks wrote ἅγγελος, 'enimn see also p. 569, and Mar. Victorin.
pp. 2462, ²4⁶5·
