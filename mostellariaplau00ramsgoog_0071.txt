What we propose at present is to examine-

1. Those kinds oi verse employed by the dramatists‚ with regard
to the existence and general structure oi which no reasonable doubts
canbeentertained. ¹

11. The prosody oi Plautus and Terence, in sofar as it is really

or apparently at variance with that with which we are familiar in the
‘works oi the Latin poets from Lucretius downwards.

lt may be urged that this is not the natural and logical arrange·
ment of the subject-that a knowledge os the prosody ought to
precede an inquiry into the versification. But in practice the plan
we have indicated will prove the more convenient. We can find
numerous examples which will enable those acquainted with the
prosody of the Augustan age to comprehend the structure os the
different verses of which we treat; and when we have acquired a
general knowledge oi these, we shall be enabled to discuss those
particular cases in which the scansion is apparently difficult or
anomalous.

is the principle vehicle ior the dialogue ol Latin comedy, when it is
carried on in a calm, unimpassioned tone. Priscian, in his treatise
Dc metrii Comari, asserta that the Iambus, the Tn'brach, the Spon-
dee, the Anapaest, and the Dactyl, are employed “ indifferenter '¹
in all the places os the Comic lambio Trimeter except the last,
which is reserved lor the Iambus exclusively, and this statement is
fully borne out by the worlrs of Plautus and Terence. It must not
however be supposed that such lines as

Tityre ta patulae rembans sud tegmrire piri,
Castaneasque nuces mea quas Amqllr's habdrl,
Huic coniux «Sychaeus erat ditaremus dgri

could be recognised, although not directly incompatible with the
above rule, any more than that

¹ could be accepted as a fair specimen of an Aristophanis Trimeter.

The Latin poets always contrive to preserve the Iambic rhythm, and
although Anapaests and Dactyls are not excluded from any one oi the
first five places, they are used more sparingly than Spondees, and not
strung together in an unbroken series in the same line. The Dactyl
