where the difficulty may at once be removed by introducing, as
proposed by Bothe, indu! the old form of fn.
α. ν. 140(Senar.),

Num hodie Amphitruo veniet hue ab exercitu.

Bothe maintains that aa hic and hoc pronaum nte os doubtful
quanxity, the szme holds good in the earlier poen with regard ω
hic and huc adverbs, xlthough this is opposed to the dictum os the
grammarians. If we have a choice ol' difficnssties, few will hesinte

ιο make hiic short rather thim extrem.
3, 1. iii. ⁶ (Troeh. Teu. Cum),
Sed uhi summus imperator non adest ad exntim.

W. gels rid os the difficulty by proposing to read estreitu. but
unfonunately there seems ιο be no auuzodty sor this sor-m. 1 would
suggest [hat the true reading is—

Sm· ιιι* summ-s mpetum no- adm exercitu,

·where extrcftu is the dative. Some hals<learued transcribet minmk
mis for exercita, Le. exereitum, and then the ad was inserted to
complete the construction.

Weise, in his Index (first edition), gives four madmena] examples
of exeram with the ix short, :11 of them from the Amphitruo.

i. ProL ιω (Sena),

Is priusquam λίπε abiit ipsenm in exereitum,
where the line suns persectly with a Spondee in the fimi plane md
a Trlbraeh in the fourth-
π. 1. i. 2⁴⁵ (Troch. Teu. ent),
Qui m· Amphitruone him una iwan fn exeram,

where W. leaves the last syllable in iveram melided, and supposes
the first in &xem‘tmu m be short, 11 is quite u simple to suppose
that cum is ue! elided, in which cnse the line muz easily with m
Anapaest in the sixth plaee-

3. 11. ii. ιοι (Troch. Teu. Cat),

Ncqu meua pedem hue fat-111· aian fn aeda, ut can· exercitu.

There are several ways in which the line may be smnued without
shortening the fim in extrem: pidem my be pronounoed aa a
monosyllable, and rhen totally elided ς or huc may be taken u short ἧ
or we mny leuve tun unelided; or we may reson ω a simple trans-
position, and read Nque pedem mum. ·
