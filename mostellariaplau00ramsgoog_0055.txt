xxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

12,13,14,1)111111141νο have also PECVNIAE once. So we have
OQVOLTOD in 10, PEQVS dis, PEQVDES, bnt also PECVDES.
PERSEQVTIO, OQVPATAM, all in 143 PEQVLAT(V) in 12,
and the blunder PEQVLATVV twice in 16. To these we may
add QVR, n. 1454, QVRA, n. 1006, QVRAVERVNT, n. 1418,
PEQVARIORV, n. 1¹30·

lt has been proposed to write the adjective reliquus, where it occurs
in Plautus, as relicuos, because it is in many cases aquadrisyllahle;
but this idea receives no support from inscriptions, in which we find
RELIQVEI [20], RELIQVIAE, 11. 1009, 1016, RELLIQVIAE,
n. 1051, and different parts of the verb relinquo, qbeing uniform in
all cases.

X, the last letter in the Latin alphabet, was, according to Isidorus
(1. 4) and Petrus Diaconus (p. 1582), not introduced until the age
of Augustus. But this is an absolute mistake, for we find SAXSVM
[0], ADVEIXI [9], EXDEICENDVM, EXDEICATIS, EX·
STRAD [10]. Much confusion however appears to have existed
with regard to the exact power 01 x, and hence we find a great
many examples 01 PROXSVMVS, MAXSVMVS, VIXSl, DEIXSI,
VXSOR, ALEXSANDER, and the like; and so SAXSVM and
EXSTRAD in the examples quoted above.

The question as to the orthography 01 Exsilium or Exrlricm
depends 01 course on considerations altogether different.

Υ did not properly belong to the Latin alphabet, hut was intro·
duced at 1 comparatively late period to represent t in words
transplanted directly from the Greek. We cannot fix with precision
the period when it was first employed in writing, but there is
scarcely a single trustworthy example 01 11 10 be found in inscrip-
tions anterior to the death of Caesar, but the t in Greek proper
names, and the like, is represented generally by u, and more rarely
by τ’, 11 in AMVCES, ERVCINA or HERVCINA, GLVCERA,
LVClOS, ILLVRICVM, PVLADES, SIBVLLA, SVRVS, dcc,
CRISIDA, HIMINIS, SISIPVS. The name HYPOLlTVS,

n. 741, Momms, belongs to an inscription certainly not older than
ΒΕ. 21.

There is no reason to believe that such 1 character was known in

the age 01 Plautus, and therefore we may safely eject it wherever it
