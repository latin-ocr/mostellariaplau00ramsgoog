xciv PROLEGOMENA.

V. ii. 34, Poen. 111. ii. aa, iii. 57, iv. aa, ν. 26, V. vi. 26. The
following are in Anapaestie lines: Bac. V. ii. 64, Mil. IV. ii. 69 (72).
The line, Bac. ΙΙ. iii. 38, cannot be scanned as it appears in the
MSS. The reading ol Rud. V. ii. 27 is very doubtful.

Ex. There are some passages quoted from Plautus in which
the syllable ex appears to be short in the words exemplum, exegere,
and ixercr'tus.

For ixemplum we are referred to Rud. Il. iii. 40 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),

Iactamur exemplet plurimis miserae perpetuom noctem.

But e'actamur is an unskilful conjecture by Schelder; all the MSS.

have-
Iactatae exemplis plurimis miserae perpetuam noctem,

which presente no difficulty either in metre or construction, lor
sacratae is here equivalent to ebriatae sumus.
derigere is quoted from Trio. IV. iii. 46 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Si mage exigere capim duarum rerum exoritur ophir.

All the MSS. have si magu Α, F, have exigere ,· B, C, D, E, have
ex gemere,· A has coaptas-duarum ; all the rest ol the MSS. cupe‘as
duarum. Since the verb exigere and its tenses occur in at least
twenty passages in Plautus with the ex long, and this is a solitary
example on the other side, this is precisely one ol those cases in
which a slight transposition may fairly be resorted to, and all difficulty
removed by reading-

Mage sr' exigere cupias duarum rerum exoritur rrph'o.

There is yet another method ol avoiding the supposition that ex
is shortened. Magis being one ol those words which may be pro·
nounced as amonosyllable‚ mage may be altogether absorbed, as not
unsrequently takes place in n‘be', tr'bt‘, sn'o, nna, eum, &e

Exercere and its tenses, exercilus and its cases, occur nearly forty
times in Plautus, and in three ol these exercitum and exercitu appear
to have the first short. It is to be remarked that the whole ol these
examples are in the Amphitruo, and two ol them within a lew lines
ol each other in the Prologus-a portion ol the play which contains
a number ol metrical hcences within a short compass, and with
regard to the genuineness ol which some good scholars have enter-
tained grave doubts. The passages are as follows :—

Exercitus 1. Amph. Prol. 125 (Senar.),

Quicum Amphitruone abrit him r'm exercilum,
