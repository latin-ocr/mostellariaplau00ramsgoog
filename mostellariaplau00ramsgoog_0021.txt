above named; and although many of the conjectural emendations
were in themselves ingenious and plausible, yet on the whole the text
of Plautus was more encumbered with a load of foreign matter and
more deformed than even in the Editio Princeps.

But a new era dawned in r 552, when a complete edition of the
· twenty plays was published at Leipsic by Joachim Camerarius, who
had previously publisbed (Lips. 1545) five pieces, and subsequently
(Lips. 1549) six more.

Camerarius had obtained possession of two MSS. unknown to
previous editors.

One of these contained the whole twenty plays, and is generally
known among critics as the Vetus Codex Camerarii, in consequence
of being older than any then known.

The other is very frequently referred to as the Codex occursurus,
because although it had originally contained the whole twenty, the
first eight bad been torn off and had disappeared before it came into
the hands of Camerarius. Both of these, the first especially, proved
of the highest value, and by their aid, combined with his own re·
markable acuteness and good sense, Camerarius, who thoroughly
understood his author, and was deeply imbued with his spirit and

phraseology, was enabled to elaborate a text immeasurably superior
to any that had been previously given to the world. He could say
with justice when he entered upon his malr—‘⁴ Si ullum cuiusquam
opus miserabiliter depravatum et corruptum scelerate fuit, hoc pro·
fecto fuit optimum et praestantissimum Plautinarum comoediarum.
Correctiones autem comprobaverunt proverbium vetus et ipsae, mul·

“nostra diligentia et industria etiam quadum permulta de nostro illo
veteri libro in Plautinis comoediis restituta sibi fuerunt, tam in verbis
quam numeris versuum, de quorum integritate nihil etiam dubii iam
nobis relinquitur. Ac possem annumerare non δεκάδας neque teneor·
eddne, sed plane χιλιάδας, si ostentare operam nostram vellemus, sed
pauperis est numerare pecus ;’' and when it was completed be was
able to boast without vainglory—“vere ac simpliciter affirmare
possum vix ullum versum, de quo non aliquid, certe paginam nullam
esse, de qua non plurimum mendomm sublatum sit.”

Not only did Camerarius collate these MSS. with so much care
and accuracy that when eagerly semtinized by subsequent scholare
wonderfully few mistalres were detected and omissions supplied, but in
consequence of his natural acuteness and his thorough acquaintance
with the spirit and phraseology of Plautus, the greater number of his
