MANUSCRlPTS OF PLAUTUS. xiii

ln v. 36, at the beginning oi the line, B has Tne in red ink from
the old hand. Camer. has erased this, and has written in his own

hand Tr. above, thusffrh'larus.

vv. 43, 44, and 45, stand in B,
Magrigs oportunus adven aduenis
Quid erl* concede huc dr'tur
Scio te borsa ἷι ne

Camer. o. 43, has r're quam and Δ at the end of the line.
v. 44, D. Quin mibi argentum red

o, 45, he adds at the end oi the line clama urinis

v. 64 stands in B,

Ferre hoc potes an quo lrabeat sorar
where Camer. has filled up the blank with

mavis ul aliquo.
u. 65 stands in B,

Vrbem exsul hic causa tui,

where Camer. [aster an erasure oi parts oi two or three words in his
own hand, as ii in some other conjecture had occurred to him
first-Eo] supplies the blank with
linquutsactur.
v. 66 stands in B,
Quoi sortem cebri. DA. Quin non pelo.

Camer. supplies vix dare li [and places a circumflex over quo‘z.
-Eo.].

It may be remarked that in these two lines the spaces lest are
much larger than would be required for the words supplied by
Camerarius.

At the end oi each line, where he has inserted a correction, Camer.
affines the mark Δ in red inlu There are in other places here and
there a few marks and scratches in the red ink oi Camer., but nothing
oi any importance.

[The only other insertion in the hand of Camerarius that I was
able to discover, was after the line (o. 78 os same scene),

Quod r'lluc crisenus obsecro quod ιἸΙῖς pelr't,

where he has written on the margin in the same line, at a short
interval, the words eia mastigia and something like dc. astarthem,

so offan]
